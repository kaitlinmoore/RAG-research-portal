This imbalance creates significant challenges, as the dataset contains far more low-risk events than high-risk collision events, making it difficult for ML models to learn effective discrimination patterns.\n\nRelated to this, **discriminative binary-classification formulations** (high-risk vs. low-risk events) have been shown to have various shortcomings, including training data class imbalance and scarce interpretability of outputs (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n## Limitations of Automated Approaches\n\nThe dataset imbalance and other challenges meant that **the use of automated, off-the-shelf ML pipelines were limited** in their effectiveness (uriot2022, sec7_p1). This suggests that simple application of standard ML techniques is insufficient for this domain.\n\n## Physics-Based Modeling Limitations\n\nA critical failure mode identified is that **predictions of future measurement updates are nearly impossible to model deterministically since they are not entirely physics-based** (mashiku2025, sec6_p1). This fundamental limitation means that ML models struggle to accurately forecast how measurements will evolve over time.\n\nAdditionally, **routine maneuvers as part of normal operations are difficult or impossible to model or incorporate within a model** (mashiku2025, sec6_p1). This represents a significant gap in ML capabilities, as operational spacecraft frequently perform planned maneuvers that affect collision risk.\n\n## Reliability for Operational Use\n\nPerhaps most critically, **AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making** (mashiku2025, sec6_p1). This indicates that despite research progress, ML methods have not reached the threshold of trustworthiness required for real-world deployment in safety-critical collision avoidance systems.\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide detailed information on:\n- Specific false positive/false negative rates\n- Model overfitting or generalization failures\n- Temporal drift in model performance\n- Specific architectural limitations of different ML approaches\n- Quantitative metrics on prediction accuracy degradation\n\nSources discussing uncertainty quantification methods, comparative performance metrics across different ML architectures, and specific operational failure case studies would help provide a more complete picture of ML failure modes in this domain.\n\n## REFERENCES\nuriot2022 — Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge (2022)\nacciarini2021 — Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions (2021)\nmashiku2025 — Future Directions and Conclusions (2025)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2521, "output_tokens": 617}}}

This move is ill-advised because it would result in a huge number of unnecessary mitigations (as an example, for events with a miss distance less than 1 km, the number with a Pc less than 1E-03 and thus not serious is six times greater than the number with a Pc greater than 1E-03). In addition, the inherent theory error (600 m to 3 km, from above) is a substantial portion of the miss-distance threshold of 1-2 km that would be imposed -- in some cases even greater than the threshold itself.

To this question are two distinct responses: (1) First, within reasonable bounds, it makes sense to protect against safety-of-flight hazards that are known and that can, if necessary, be mitigated. NASA CARA's statement of purpose is \"to take prudent measures, at reasonable cost, to enhance safety of flight, without placing an undue burden on mission operations.\" An unjustified over-investment in safety should be avoided, and mission objectives should not be regularly and substantially impaired by conjunction assessment considerations. But since it is not particularly expensive or difficult to identify high-risk conjunctions from the existing space catalog, and since such conjunctions are relatively infrequent, and furthermore, since the need for mitigation action for such conjunctions is less than an order of magnitude less frequent than that, it is good safety practice to conduct conjunction assessment operations according to the CARA mission statement.

This applies to cases such as \"potential autonomously controlled missions that will perform onboard conjunction assessment\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec13_p1), but does not specifically mention ML.\n\n2. **Commercial SSA data integration**: The evidence discusses the potential use of commercial Space Situational Awareness (SSA) data, noting that while properly calibrated commercial tracking data \"should result in a more reliable orbit determination solution with a smaller uncertainty, the effect may be such that the use of these additional data would rarely, if ever, result in a different operational decision\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec14.3_p1). However, this concerns data sources rather than ML methods.\n\n3. **Current risk assessment methodology**: NASA CARA uses Probability of Collision (Pc) as their chosen metric, which \"can be computed quite accurately in many astrodynamically demanding circumstances\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec15.3_p2), but this does not address whether ML is used in these calculations.\n\n**What is missing**: The evidence does not contain any specific discussion of ML algorithms, neural networks, or other machine learning approaches for conjunction assessment.

More specifically, the total dataset is divided randomly into a training set and a testing set, where the testing data are within the same time interval as the training set (peng2018, sec3_p1). This represents the common practice in the machine learning area (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n**Type II: Generalization capability to future epochs (Forecasting)**\nThis type trains an algorithm to predict the future position of a space object beyond the training data timeframe (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1). The testing data are restricted to be in the future epoch with respect to the training data, which reflects the realistic orbit prediction problem (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n**Type III: Generalization capability to different but nearby RSOs in future epochs (Extrapolation)**\nThis extends ML capabilities to extrapolate information from one object to predict the orbit of a different space object (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1). More specifically, this capability means learning some patterns from a limited number of RSOs (Resident Space Objects), and then applying the knowledge onto other RSOs (peng2018, sec3_p1). This is described as a generalization type that can be very important for SSA (Space Situational Awareness) (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n## REFERENCES\n- precise_orbit_ml2024 — Related Work (2024)\n- peng2018 — Generalization Capability at Future Epochs (2018)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2155, "output_tokens": 423}}}

According to He et al., \"the dynamic factors influencing the decay, such as the space environment and spacecraft physical parameters, pose a challenge of catastrophic forgetting for conventional MLT\" (he2024, sec1_p6). This phenomenon limits the generalization capabilities of current model-agnostic machine learning techniques (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\nThe evidence indicates that catastrophic forgetting is specifically problematic in the context of Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) spacecraft, where the generalization performance of machine learning techniques \"is blocked by the universal challenge known as catastrophic forgetting, resulting in limited improvement on PODP [precise orbit decay prediction]\" (he2024, sec0_p1).\n\n## He 2024's Solution: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)\n\nTo address catastrophic forgetting, He et al. propose using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) as part of their Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (EODP) method. The study explains that \"EODP employs a deep NN (DNN) as the fundamental learner to comprehend the decaying rule and incorporates the theory of EWC\" (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\nThe rationale for selecting EWC is explained in their discussion of various strategies to enhance neural network generalization performance. They note that \"EWC combines historical and recent training data to update the NN parameters by applying a penalty function, commonly used to process large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets in the field of earth observation\" (he2024, sec1_p6). Importantly, they identify that \"EWC is particularly suited for regression problems with abundant training data\" (he2024, sec1_p6), which aligns well with the orbit decay prediction problem.\n\n## Context and Alternative Approaches\n\nThe evidence also mentions alternative strategies that were considered but not selected for this application. Meta-learning \"seeks to achieve 'learning to learn,' allowing NN to be flexible and adaptable in various scenarios\" and \"excels in few-shot learning\" (he2024, sec1_p6). Experience replay \"involves the creation of a small memory buffer to retain samples from previous tasks\" and \"efficiently constructs and utilizes memory buffers with a limited sample size\" (he2024, sec1_p6).

Various tasks such as satellite formation, on-orbit servicing, and active debris removal require object recognition to be done perfectly. The recognition task in actual space imagery is highly complex because the sensing conditions are largely diverse. The conditions include various backgrounds affected by noise, several orbital scenarios, high contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, and various object sizes. To address the problem of space recognition, this paper proposes a multi-modal learning solution using various deep learning models. To extract features from RGB images that have spacecraft and debris, various convolutional neural network (CNN) based models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet were explored. Furthermore, RGB based vision transformer was demonstrated. Additionally, End-to-End CNN was used for classification of depth images. The final decision of the proposed solution combines the two decisions from RGB based and Depth-based models. The experiments were carried out using a novel dataset called SPARK which was generated under a realistic space simulation environment. The dataset includes various images with eleven categories, and it is divided into 150 k of RGB images and 150 k of depth images. The proposed combination of RGB based vision transformer and Depth-based End-to-End CNN showed higher performance and better results in terms of accuracy (85%), precision (86%), recall (85%), and F1 score (84%).

The research concluded that \"significant advances in data collection, model interpretability, and validation methodologies would be required before machine learning techniques could be considered viable for operational conjunction assessment applications\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3).\n\n**Limited Ground Truth Data**: Training AI/ML systems for Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) operations \"necessitates access to verified ground truth data,\" yet \"comprehensive collision datasets remain limited\" (mashiku2025, sec2_p5). This poses a significant challenge for developing reliable ML models.\n\n## Reliability and Explainability Requirements\n\n**High Reliability Standards**: ML approaches face \"difficulty in achieving the high reliability and explainability standards required for a high-value, high-risk space operations decision-making paradigm\" (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). These high reliability standards must be maintained as automation increases (mashiku2025, sec6_p3).\n\n**Explainability Paradox**: The \"'explainability' paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches posed significant concerns for operational implementation, as conjunction assessment decisions require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome\" (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Validation and Operational Readiness\n\n**Insufficient Validation**: Machine learning techniques \"showed theoretical promise for enhancing conjunction assessment capabilities,\" but \"significant additional work would be needed to overcome stochastic data limitations, improve model interpretability, and demonstrate reliable performance via validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios before these methods could be considered for operational deployment\" (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Uncertainty Quantification\n\nThe research addresses \"the need for uncertainty quantification in AI/ML tools for both improving the prediction and classification performance and mitigating some of the potential AI/ML policy barriers, including facilitating operator-machine teaming and operator trust\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p3).\n\n## Current Limitations and Future Approaches\n\nNASA acknowledges that \"fully automated AI/ML decision systems are not currently viable for operational risk assessment\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p3). Instead, hybrid approaches are suggested, where ML might assist with \"identifying which conjunction events deserve analyst attention, rather than performing risk assessments and conclusive early decision-support for mitigative maneuver decisions\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p3). This reflects a more cautious, tiered approach where \"future AI/ML approaches may yet find valuable niches within the broader conjunction assessment workflow, even if they cannot yet replace traditional physics-based methods entirely\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p4).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide specific details about:\n- Integration challenges with existing operational systems and workflows\n- Computational resource requirements\n- Training time and update frequency requirements\n- Specific policy or regulatory barriers beyond explainability concerns\n- Cost considerations for ML implementation\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\nmashiku2025 — Findings and Challenges in ML for Conjunction Assessment (2025)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 — AI/ML for Space Domain Awareness Case Studies (2024)\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 — NASA Conjunction Assessment Handbook (2023)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2018, "output_tokens": 786}}}

However, as previously mentioned, the dataset is extremely imbalanced with only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than −6. To mitigate this problem a strategy is followed. It was verified that when the naive forecast predicts the final risk value of an event as −30 (the risk values are truncated at that lower bound), 99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events (after the removal of CDMs containing extreme outliers and parameters with impossible values). Thus, in this work, it is assumed that the −30 predictions by the naive forecast are trustworthy and, consequently, it is considered that those events do not require the application of ML models. So, those events are not used for training and, during the test phase, are directly predicted with a final risk of −30.

The problem is characterized as \"unavoidable\" in nature (uriot2022, sec7_p1), with the dataset for the collision avoidance challenge being \"highly unbalanced\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). One specific study notes that \"the dataset is extremely imbalanced with only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than −6\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**Impact on Training:** The imbalance affected training approaches, as 65% of competition participants explicitly attempted to address class imbalance through various methods such as artificially balancing classes or assigning importance weighting to samples (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). Additionally, half of the participants attempted to build validation sets with similar properties to the test set but failed, with most teams reporting \"a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**Operational Limitations:** The imbalance problem is so fundamental that it limited \"the use of automated, off-the-shelf ML pipelines\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1), suggesting that standard ML approaches cannot be directly applied without modification.\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nThe corpus describes several approaches to addressing class imbalance:\n\n**1. Generative Modeling Approach:** Rather than using discriminative binary-classification, researchers focused on \"generative modeling of the problem\" to describe \"the temporal evolution of a sequence of CDMs given all previously observed CDMs\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1). This represents a fundamental reframing of the problem to avoid the classification imbalance issue.\n\n**2. Selective Filtering Strategy:** A sophisticated filtering approach was proposed where predictions from naive forecasts at the lowest risk level (−30) were deemed trustworthy, with 99.34% accuracy and no misclassification of high-risk events (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). Events predicted at this level were excluded from ML training and directly assigned a final risk of −30 during testing, which \"can help deal with the data imbalance problem\" while reducing computational requirements (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**3.

The uncertainty arises from the parameter samples themselves, with wider posterior distributions indicating higher uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3).\n\n### Uncertainty Techniques in Atmospheric Density Prediction\n\nThe corpus references uncertainty techniques evaluated for atmospheric density prediction models, where models were selected based on \"lowest prediction error and best calibration scores\" (licata2022, sec8_p1). Calibration error was used as a key metric, measuring the average absolute difference between expected and observed cumulative probability across prediction intervals (licata2022, sec5.5_p1).\n\n### Uncertainty-Aware Inference\n\nOne study observed that uncertainty values in target spacecraft radial velocity were \"generally higher for misclassified events\" in conjunction assessment (uriot2022, sec5.4_p2). This suggests potential value in models that incorporate uncertainties at inference time, \"for instance, by outputting a risk distribution instead of a point prediction\" (uriot2022, sec5.4_p2).\n\n## Performance Comparisons\n\n### BNNs vs. Standard Neural Networks (SNNs)\n\nThe evidence indicates that methods accounting for uncertainty quantification showed \"better prediction and classification performance\" compared to SNN approaches in case studies, though this is noted as not being a general statement (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6). BNNs are identified as \"preferable to SNNs when uncertainty is a necessary output, when there are limited available training data, and when the detection of outlier predictions is important to flag for an operator\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6).\n\n### Operational Benefits\n\nUncertainty quantification enables operators to provide feedback by \"setting thresholds based on acceptable risk\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p5).

The traditional orbital prediction methods (TOPMs) based on physical models are inaccurate with divergent errors in PODP due to the challenges of modeling the atmosphere and acquiring the physical information of specific spacecraft [10]. Orbit decay with TOPM also depends on the information of space environment, which is hard to accurately predict. In recent years, several methods with machine learning techniques (MLTs) have emerged to enhance the capabilities of TOPM. Cimmino, Opromolla, and Fasano [11] used MLT to determine the ballistic coefficients of LEO spacecraft based on orbital data. This approach can minimize prediction errors stemming from uncertainties in drag coefficients and area-to-mass ratios. Lei and Zhang [12] employed another form of proximal policy optimization, PPO2, to adjust atmosphere model parameters to improve TOPM. Compared to standard orbital data, the proposed method resulted in a maximum absolute space position error of 8133.329 m on the CSS in 3 days. Peng and Bai [13] used an artificial neural network (NN) to compensate for TOPM errors. Compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP), the proposed approach significantly reduced residual errors. Li et al. [14] captured the error patterns to adjust the physical model with MLT based on historical prediction errors of space debris, which enhanced the capability of space situational awareness.

Generalization performance of machine learning techniques (MLTs) is blocked by the universal challenge known as catastrophic forgetting, resulting in limited improvement on PODP. In this study, a method of expandable orbit decay propagator (EODP) for spacecraft PODP in VLEO, based on model-agnostic MLTs, is proposed.

For a particular close approach, the last obtained CDM can be assumed to be the best knowledge available on the potential collision and the state of the two objects in question. If the estimated collision risk for a particular event is close to or above the reaction threshold (e.g., 10^âˆ’4), the Space Debris Office will alarm control teams and begin planning a potential avoidance maneuver a few days prior to the close approach, as well as meeting the flight dynamics and mission operations teams.

To mitigate this problem a strategy is followed. It was verified that when the naive forecast predicts the final risk value of an event as −30 (the risk values are truncated at that lower bound), 99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events (after the removal of CDMs containing extreme outliers and parameters with impossible values). Thus, in this work, it is assumed that the −30 predictions by the naive forecast are trustworthy and, consequently, it is considered that those events do not require the application of ML models. So, those events are not used for training and, during the test phase, are directly predicted with a final risk of −30.

To infer the parameters of each model, current MCMC samplers require the evaluation of the log-likelihood density at each set of observations for each proposed set of parameters to be sampled. But, each event has a different number of CDMs, hence, to obtain the log probability of the model, it would be necessary to separately compute, in a loop, the logarithm of equation (4) for every set of observations of each event and then sum the result to obtain the joint log probability of the model. This would make the training of the model extremely slow and inefficient since this process would have to be repeated for every set of parameters to be sampled. A solution is to vectorize the sequences of CDMs and compute the log-likelihood density for each sequence at once and then sum the result. To vectorize the sequences of collision warnings, an approximation must be done regarding the data setup of the training set. Typically, in real collision events, 3 CDMs are released per day [7] during the week leading up to the TCA, where the latest CDM available is always considered the best knowledge about the outcome of the close approach. Thus, an approach to ensure that all input sequences (events) have the same number of observations (CDMs) is to verify whether 3 CDMs are received each day and, if less than 3 collision warnings are received, the latest CDM received is repeated until there are 3 on that day. If there are no CDMs received prior to that day, the first observation received is repeated. This process is done for all days during the week leading up to the TCA and, after this, the events that don't match the highest number of observations are, again, manipulated by repeating the first released CDM."}, {"id": "uriot2022::sec1.1_p3", "source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p3", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "year": 2022, "authors": "Thomas Uriot, Dario Izzo, Luis F.

The dataset used across multiple studies shows that only 2.77% of events (365 out of 13,154) are classified as high-risk conjunctions, while 97.23% (12,789 events) are low-risk (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This severe class imbalance is identified as \"the main challenge in collision risk estimation using ML methods\" (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\nThe imbalance is even more extreme when examining the data distribution: 63.5% of all conjunction events have a final risk value truncated at -30 (the lower bound), representing false alerts (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This means that the vast majority of training data represents extremely low-risk scenarios, making it difficult for supervised learning models to learn patterns associated with genuinely dangerous encounters.\n\n## Training Challenges\n\nThe rarity of actual collision events creates multiple training difficulties:\n\n1. **Difficulty in Pattern Recognition**: The scarcity of collision events makes it \"difficult to train supervised learning models that could accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n2. **Inconsistent Behavioral Patterns**: The problem is compounded by the fact that \"sample cases generated from the same baseline often exhibited completely different behavioral patterns, undermining the assumption that historical patterns could reliably predict future conjunction evolution\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). This inconsistency, combined with rarity, means there are few examples and those examples don't follow predictable patterns.\n\n3. **Stochastic Nature**: The \"stochastic and non-linear nature of the conjunction evolution created inconsistent parameter behavior patterns that were difficult for machine learning models to capture reliably\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\nResearchers have attempted to address the class imbalance through data preparation strategies. One approach involves removing the most extreme low-risk cases from training: when a naive forecast predicts a final risk of -30, 99.34% of predictions are correct with no misclassification of high-risk events (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). By excluding these -30 predictions from training and directly predicting them as -30 during testing, researchers can \"deal with the data imbalance problem\" while also reducing memory requirements and computational time (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\nAdditionally, data vectorization techniques are employed to handle the variable number of CDMs (Conjunction Data Messages) per event, with sequences being standardized by repeating CDMs to ensure uniform input dimensions for training (catulo2023, sec3.3_p4).\n\n## Validation Challenges\n\nThe rarity of collision events also affects validation approaches. The evidence notes that \"comprehensive collision datasets remain limited,\" requiring researchers to rely on \"theoretical assessment of close conjunction events characterized by non-zero miss distances\" as \"a viable foundation for evaluating the operational validity of AI/ML implementation\" (mashiku2025, sec2_p5). This suggests that validation must often occur on near-miss events rather than actual collisions, which may not fully represent the characteristics of true collision scenarios.\n\nThe European Space Agency's Collision Avoidance Challenge was specifically designed to \"study the feasibility of applying machine learning (ML) methods in collision risk estimation\" using a curated dataset spanning 2015-2019 (uriot2022, sec0_p1).

The atmosphere drag force, along with solar radiation pressure and RSO shape/attitude motion, is \"difficult to be accurately modeled\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p1). This modeling difficulty stems from multiple sources: the challenges of \"modeling the atmosphere and acquiring the physical information of specific spacecraft\" (he2024, sec1_p4), and the fact that \"orbit decay with TOPM also depends on the information of space environment, which is hard to accurately predict\" (he2024, sec1_p4).\n\n## How ML Approaches Address Atmospheric Uncertainty\n\nML-based orbit prediction pipelines attempt to compensate for atmospheric drag uncertainty through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Error Pattern Learning**: ML approaches are designed to \"discover the hidden relationship between the available variables and the orbit prediction error from historical data,\" with the speculation that \"the effect of these unmodeled factors is hidden in the historical data of measurements, estimations, and orbit predictions\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p2).\n\n2. **Environmental Variable Integration**: Some ML algorithms forecast state vectors \"using past positions and environmental variables like atmospheric density from external sources\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec0_p1).\n\n3. **Atmospheric Density Modeling**: ML techniques have been applied specifically to density estimation, with models achieving \"errors of approximately 11% on independent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates\" when trained on global density databases (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n4. **Parameter Adjustment**: Some methods use ML \"to adjust atmosphere model parameters to improve TOPM,\" though one such approach still resulted in \"a maximum absolute space position error of 8133.329 m on the CSS in 3 days\" (he2024, sec1_p4).\n\n## Uncertainty Quantification in ML Pipelines\n\nThe propagation of atmospheric uncertainty through ML pipelines is addressed through uncertainty estimation techniques:\n\n- **Bayesian Approaches**: \"Bayesian counterparts of Neural Networks, which predict a distribution, are being explored,\" including methods that combine \"Gaussian Processes (GP) uncertainty with EKF-derived uncertainty\" and \"Deep Ensemble to perform variance estimation\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec6_p2).\n\n- **Covariance Prediction**: An \"augmented, covariance predicting, AI framework\" has been demonstrated where \"the relative size of the predictive covariance is an indicator of how well this 'uncertainty-aware' AI approach understands a given RSO's orbit,\" allowing the system to \"overtly predicts large amounts of uncertainty rather than silently producing wrong results\" in outlier situations (vanslette2024, sec0_p1).\n\n- **Calibrated Uncertainty Estimates**: Models using techniques like \"Monte Carlo (MC) dropout and direct prediction of the probability distribution\" can achieve predictions that are \"within 2% of perfect calibration for the twenty prediction intervals tested\" (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n## Downstream Effects on Collision Probability Estimates\n\n### Identified Challenges\n\nThe evidence identifies several ways atmospheric drag uncertainty affects collision assessment:\n\n1. **Position Error Accumulation**: Current approximate physics-based methods \"have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, which is insufficient when considering space debris, typically with less than one meter\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec0_p1). While this statistic isn't specific to ML methods, it illustrates the severity of position uncertainty.\n\n2. **Space Operations Impact**: \"Our inability to forecast [the thermosphere] has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations\" (licata2022, sec0_p1).\n\n3. **Uncertainty Distribution Limitations**: Current limitations in orbit prediction include \"the Gaussian assumption – which does not hold against the true distribution\" and \"the uncertainty over space weather forecast data\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3).\n\n### Operational Implications\n\nThe uncertainty-aware AI framework enables \"down-stream decision systems to choose whether a given AI prediction should be trusted and utilized or ignored and replaced,\" which is described as \"a key feature for robust and performant SDA applications\" (vanslette2024, sec0_p1). This suggests that properly quantified uncertainty allows for more informed collision avoidance decisions.\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe provided evidence does **not** contain:\n\n1. **Explicit quantification** of how atmospheric drag uncertainty specifically propagates through ML pipelines versus traditional methods\n2. **Direct comparison** of collision probability estimates between ML-based and physics-based methods\n3. **Specific failure modes** where atmospheric drag uncertainty causes false negatives or false positives in collision warnings\n4. **Statistical relationships** between atmospheric density model errors and final conjunction probability estimates\n5. **Real-world case studies** of how atmospheric drag uncertainty affected actual collision avoidance maneuvers using ML methods\n\nSources that might help fill these gaps would include: operational conjunction assessment data from satellite operators, comparative studies of ML versus traditional methods in actual collision scenarios, and detailed error propagation analyses through complete collision assessment pipelines.\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- he2024 — Junhua He et al., Orbital Prediction Challenges (2024)\n- licata2022 — Richard J.

The last CDM that is at least two days away from the TCA, the most recent CDM available to operators when making the final planning decisions, was used here as the sole input to the model. In other words, temporal information from the CDM time series was not considered. From that CDM, only the numerical features were used; the two categorical features (mission_id and object_type) were discarded. Thus, for models to learn mission or object-specific rules, they would have to utilize features encoding relevant properties of that feature or object. It was hoped that this would force the model to learn more generalizable rules. In addition to this step, no other transformations were applied to the CDM raw values (such as scaling or embedding). Similarly, no steps were implemented to impute the missing values that occurred at times in many of the CDM variables.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks\n\nLSTM networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that retains memory about inputs and utilizes that memory to predict outcomes on time-dependent series, have been implemented to handle the time-varying nature of CDM data as conjunction assessments evolve toward TCA (mashiku2025, sec3.4_p1). Bayesian recurrent neural networks (specifically stacked LSTM architectures) have been designed to predict future CDMs in conjunction events, with the network returning distributions rather than point predictions due to their Bayesian nature (acciarini2021, sec4.2_p2). Manhattan LSTMs showed good performance during the Collision Avoidance Challenge (catulo2023, sec1_p6).\n\n### 2. Shallow Neural Networks\n\nShallow binary classification networks have been applied, with models incorporating multiple information parameters beyond just collision probability (Pc) (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n### 3. Deep Neural Networks\n\nDeep Neural Networks have been applied to static CDM analysis (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n### 4. Gradient Boosting Trees\n\nGradient boosting trees (specifically LightGBM) showed good performance during the Collision Avoidance Challenge (catulo2023, sec1_p6). These were applied without transformations to CDM raw values such as scaling or embedding, and without steps to impute missing values (uriot2022, sec6.1_p1).\n\n### 5. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)\n\nHMMs have been applied to analyze CDM time series arranged in descending order regarding time to TCA (catulo2023, sec3.3_p3).\n\n## Comparison of Failure Modes\n\n### LSTM Failure Modes\n\n**Insufficient Training Data and Poor Generalization**: The LSTM models designed for time-series prediction suffered from insufficient \"ground truth data\" for training and poor generalization to diverse conjunction scenarios (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n**Long-term Prediction Degradation**: For long-term forecasting (around 100 years), both overlapping and non-overlapping LSTM strategies failed dramatically, reaching loss values six orders of magnitude larger than short-term benchmarks. The overlapping approach showed huge increases in the loss function especially in the first year. The degradation is attributed to the number of iterations needed to span long periods of time (mocat_ml2024, sec5.2_p4).\n\n### Shallow Neural Network Failure Modes\n\n**Marginal Improvements**: Shallow binary classification networks showed only marginal improvements in risk classification when incorporating multiple information parameters beyond just Pc. The improvement appeared extremely marginal compared to using normal Pc thresholds, raising questions about the practical value of the additional computational complexity (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n**Linear Complexity Limitations**: Shallow neural networks are susceptible to errors from highly nonlinear coupling due to operating at a linear level of complexity (mashiku2025, sec3.4_p1).\n\n### Deep Neural Network Failure Modes\n\n**Lack of Memory**: Standard neural networks (either shallow or deep) do not remember or account for previous time-series inputs but only focus on the immediate past data during the training phase (mashiku2025, sec3.4_p1).\n\n### General Observation Across Architectures\n\n**Limited Use of Temporal Information**: Surprisingly, 65% of teams in the Collision Avoidance Challenge framed the learning problem as a static one, summarizing the information contained in the time series as an aggregation of attributes (e.g., using summary statistics, or simply the latest available CDM) rather than utilizing temporal evolution (uriot2022, sec5.1_p4). This suggests that many ML approaches failed to effectively leverage the temporal structure of CDM data, possibly because the naive forecast (using the last CDM as the prediction) proved to be a strong predictor, with only 12 teams out of 97 managing to beat the benchmark solution (catulo2023, sec1_p6).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence provided does not include:\n- Quantitative comparison metrics (e.g., specific accuracy, F1 scores, or loss values) across different architectures\n- Detailed analysis of failure modes for gradient boosting trees and HMMs\n- Information about ensemble methods or hybrid architectures\n- Specific error patterns or failure scenarios for each architecture type\n\nSources that might provide additional comparative analysis of specific failure scenarios and quantitative performance metrics would help complete this assessment.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nacciarini2021 — Bayesian Recurrent Neural Networks for CDM Prediction (2021)\ncatulo2023 — Hidden Markov Models for Collision Risk Assessment (2023)\nmashiku2025 — Comparative Analysis of Different AI/ML Approaches for Space Debris Tracking (2025)\nmocat_ml2024 — Long Term Prediction with Neural Networks (2024)\nuriot2022 — Collision Avoidance Challenge: ML Approaches and Results (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2786, "output_tokens": 1199}}}

As noted in [16], investigating Recurring Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM models to ingest time-series based information could eventually provide more reliable predictions at TCA, especially if approaches can be developed that incorporate uncertainty quantification in the predictions. Future studies should carefully consider that predictions of future measurement updates are nearly impossible to model deterministically since they are not entirely physics-based, and that routine maneuvers as part of normal operations are difficult or impossible to model or incorporate within a model.

Future studies should carefully consider that predictions of future measurement updates are nearly impossible to model deterministically since they are not entirely physics-based, and that routine maneuvers as part of normal operations are difficult or impossible to model or incorporate within a model.

This information is crucial for maintaining the safety and sustainability of space operations, as it allows operators to monitor and predict the behaviour of objects in space, including potential collisions [9]."}, {"id": "massimi2024::sec2_p1", "source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Related Works", "year": 2024, "authors": "Federica Massimi, Pasquale Ferrara, Roberto Petrucci, Francesco Benedetto", "distance": 0.4722335934638977, "rerank_score": 1.4296194314956665, "text": "To mitigate the risks posed by space debris, it is essential to have accurate and up-to-date information on the location and trajectory of debris objects.

Phased Array Radar. This type of radar uses multiple antennas that can steer the beam in different directions without the need for any physical movement of the antenna itself. This allows for faster scanning of the sky and detection objects in multiple directions simultaneously. 2. Monostatic and Bistatic Radar. Monostatic radar uses a single antenna for both transmitting and receiving signals, while bistatic radar uses separate antennas. Bistatic radar can have better performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity, but it requires more hardware. 3. Multistatic radar involves multiple antennas for both transmitting and receiving signals. The antennas are distributed in different locations, creating a network of radar nodes that work together to detect and track targets. Multistatic radar offers enhanced coverage, increased system redundancy, and improved target detection capabilities. 4. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) uses a large antenna or multiple antennas that can be combined to create a virtual antenna that is much larger than the physical antenna. This allows for higher resolution imaging of objects in space. SAR systems use flexible orbits, frequent data acquisition, and Doppler effect adjustments to target extremely manoeuvrable targets. Certain systems employ sophisticated methods like multi-pass interferometry and moving target tracking along with tracking devices to pursue these kinds of targets. Target comprehension is enhanced by integration with additional sensors, and real-time processing is essential for applications that call for quick judgements."}, {"id": "massimi2024::sec1_p9", "source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p9", "section_title": "Introduction", "year": 2024, "authors": "Federica Massimi, Pasquale Ferrara, Roberto Petrucci, Francesco Benedetto", "distance": 0.5201269388198853, "rerank_score": -0.8161723017692566, "text": "The primary aim of this work is to present alternative and innovative methods for space debris detection using DL techniques.

Figure E-3 suggests that a miss-distance criterion of several hundred meters, or perhaps 1-2 km, could be used as a simplified method of performing a risk-tolerant conjunction assessment: remediate any conjunctions with a miss distance less than 1-2 km. This move is ill-advised because it would result in a huge number of unnecessary mitigations (as an example, for events with a miss distance less than 1 km, the number with a Pc less than 1E-03 and thus not serious is six times greater than the number with a Pc greater than 1E-03). In addition, the inherent theory error (600 m to 3 km, from above) is a substantial portion of the miss-distance threshold of 1-2 km that would be imposed -- in some cases even greater than the threshold itself. So even under the very limited case described here, the use of general perturbation results for conjunction risk assessment is not tenable.

This was the threshold defined during the CAC [7] and, since the same dataset is used and in order to better compare the obtained results, the same threshold is chosen in this work. Thus, in the dataset there are 12789 low-risk events (97.23%) and only 365 high-risk conjunctions (2.77%), highlighting the rare occurrence of high-risk events. The data imbalance problem poses to be the main challenge in collision risk estimation using ML methods. It is also important to note that the values of the risk contained in the CDMs are truncated at a lower bound of −30, in other words, the probability is truncated at 10⁻³⁰.

The traditional orbital prediction methods (TOPMs) based on physical models are inaccurate with divergent errors in PODP due to the challenges of modeling the atmosphere and acquiring the physical information of specific spacecraft [10]. Orbit decay with TOPM also depends on the information of space environment, which is hard to accurately predict. In recent years, several methods with machine learning techniques (MLTs) have emerged to enhance the capabilities of TOPM. Cimmino, Opromolla, and Fasano [11] used MLT to determine the ballistic coefficients of LEO spacecraft based on orbital data. This approach can minimize prediction errors stemming from uncertainties in drag coefficients and area-to-mass ratios. Lei and Zhang [12] employed another form of proximal policy optimization, PPO2, to adjust atmosphere model parameters to improve TOPM. Compared to standard orbital data, the proposed method resulted in a maximum absolute space position error of 8133.329 m on the CSS in 3 days. Peng and Bai [13] used an artificial neural network (NN) to compensate for TOPM errors. Compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP), the proposed approach significantly reduced residual errors. Li et al.

According to He et al., the dynamic factors influencing orbital decay, such as the space environment and spacecraft physical parameters, create a challenge of catastrophic forgetting for conventional MLT (he2024, sec1_p6). More specifically, the generalization performance of machine learning techniques is \"blocked by the universal challenge known as catastrophic forgetting, resulting in limited improvement on PODP [precise orbit decay prediction]\" (he2024, sec0_p1).\n\nThe issue appears to stem from the varying conditions that MLTs must handle in orbit prediction scenarios. Current model-agnostic MLTs face limitations in their generalization capabilities due to this phenomenon (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n## He 2024's Solution: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)\n\nTo address catastrophic forgetting, He et al. employ **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** as part of their Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (EODP) method. The EODP \"employs a deep NN (DNN) as the fundamental learner to comprehend the decaying rule and incorporates the theory of EWC\" (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\nEWC is described as a regularization-based approach that \"combines historical and recent training data to update the NN parameters by applying a penalty function\" (he2024, sec1_p6). The authors note that EWC is \"particularly suited for regression problems with abundant training data\" (he2024, sec1_p6), which aligns with the characteristics of orbit decay prediction problems where historical orbital data can be extensive.\n\n## Rationale for Choosing EWC\n\nHe et al. considered multiple strategies to enhance generalization performance of neural networks, including:\n- Optimization-based methods (like meta-learning)\n- Replay-based techniques (such as experience replay)\n- Regularization-based approaches (like EWC)\n\nThey chose EWC over alternatives because \"meta-learning methods excel in few-shot learning, and experience replay efficiently constructs and utilizes memory buffers with a limited sample size. EWC is particularly suited for regression problems with abundant training data\" (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n## Results\n\nThe proposed EODP method \"achieves at least a 70% improvement in accuracy compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP)\" (he2024, sec0_p1), and compared to previous methods, \"EODP greatly improves prediction accuracy and generalization performance\" (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 — Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator for Spacecraft PODP in VLEO (2024)\n\npeng2018 — Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem (2018)\n\nsurvey_ml_orbit2024 — Survey of ML in Orbit Prediction (2024)\n\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 — Precise Orbit ML (2024)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2827, "output_tokens": 723}}}

In parallel with improvements to data infrastructure, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies present one opportunity to improve SDA mission processes by providing operators with methods to quickly analyze large volumes of data. Understanding how to optimally leverage these technologies and planning for their expected impact on the SDA mission could potentially help improve mission effectiveness, optimize resource management, and inform investment decisions. This chapter provides an overview of the technologies, processes, and organizations that compose SDA operations at U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM), focusing on select current mission processes that provide context to the AI/ML case studies presented later in the report."}, {"id": "rand_ai_ssa2024::sec0_p2", "source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Summary", "year": 2024, "authors": "Jonathan Tran, Prateek Puri, Jordan Logue, Anthony Jacques, Li Ang Zhang, Krista Langeland, George Nacouzi, Gary J.

This necessitates reliance on theoretical assessments of close conjunction events with non-zero miss distances as a foundation for evaluation (mashiku2025, sec2_p5).\n\n**High-Quality Training Data Requirements**: The development of effective AI/ML tools requires significant investment in ensuring high-quality training data (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p8). Organizations must continuously collect high-quality input-output data from analysis tasks to curate databases for training future systems (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p8).\n\n## Model Performance and Reliability Challenges\n\n**Stochasticity Issues**: The investigation revealed fundamental challenges due to the stochasticity of the data and the complex and stochastic nature of orbital mechanics (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). These factors limited the operational applicability of machine learning approaches for conjunction assessment (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n**High Reliability Standards**: There is difficulty in achieving the high reliability standards required for high-value, high-risk space operations decision-making (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). Significant additional work is needed to demonstrate reliable performance through validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios before these methods could be considered for operational deployment (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Explainability and Trust Challenges\n\n**The Explainability Paradox**: Many machine learning approaches pose significant concerns for operational implementation due to inherent explainability limitations (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). Conjunction assessment decisions require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n**Operator Trust and Human-Machine Teaming**: The report addresses the need for uncertainty quantification in AI/ML tools to facilitate operator-machine teaming and operator trust, which are potential AI/ML policy barriers (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p3).\n\n## Validation and Interpretability Challenges\n\n**Model Interpretability**: Improving model interpretability is identified as a significant challenge that must be overcome (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). The research concluded that significant advances in model interpretability and validation methodologies would be required before machine learning techniques could be considered viable for operational conjunction assessment applications (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3).\n\n**Validation Across Scenarios**: Demonstrating reliable performance via validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios is necessary before operational deployment can be considered (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Operational Integration Challenges\n\n**Process and System Design Implications**: AI/ML tool developers must consider SDA processes and limitations that have implications for tool design, including the selection of algorithms, metrics of performance, and benchmark requirements (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p9). There is a need to avoid developing AI/ML solutions that operators cannot implement and use (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p9).\n\nNASA's research concluded that while machine learning techniques showed theoretical promise for enhancing conjunction assessment capabilities, these fundamental challenges indicate that significant additional work would be needed before operational deployment (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nmashiku2025 — Satellite C - Maneuverable Asset Response; Introduction and Problem Statement; Findings and Challenges; Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks; Future Directions and Conclusions (2025)\n\nrand_ai_ssa2024 — Summary; Space Domain Awareness Mission Overview; Conclusion (2024)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2300, "output_tokens": 858}}}

To mitigate this problem a strategy is followed. It was verified that when the naive forecast predicts the final risk value of an event as −30 (the risk values are truncated at that lower bound), 99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events (after the removal of CDMs containing extreme outliers and parameters with impossible values). Thus, in this work, it is assumed that the −30 predictions by the naive forecast are trustworthy and, consequently, it is considered that those events do not require the application of ML models. So, those events are not used for training and, during the test phase, are directly predicted with a final risk of −30.

A majority (65%) of competition participants recognized this issue and attempted to address it (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). The severity is quantified in one study: \"only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than −6\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**Root Cause**: The imbalance stems from \"the rarity of actual collision events in the historical dataset\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1), which creates \"a severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to train supervised learning models that could accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n**Impact on Model Development**: The class imbalance problem was cited as one of \"various shortcomings\" of approaching collision avoidance as a \"discriminative binary-classification formulation in ML (i.e., high- vs low-risk events)\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1). This suggests the imbalance fundamentally affects the choice of ML approach itself.\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nThe evidence documents several proposed solutions to address class imbalance:\n\n**1. Explicit Balancing Techniques**: Competition participants attempted to \"artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3), though the evidence doesn't report on the effectiveness of these approaches.\n\n**2. Data Filtering Strategy**: One specific approach involved removing trustworthy low-risk predictions from the training set. When the naive forecast predicted a final risk of -30, \"99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events,\" so these events were excluded from training and directly predicted as -30 during testing (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). This approach \"can help deal with the data imbalance problem, and the volume of training data is reduced, resulting in lower memory requirements and a lower computational time\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**3. Reformulation from Discriminative to Generative Models**: Rather than treating the problem as binary classification (which suffers from class imbalance), researchers proposed \"generative modeling of the problem\" to \"describe the temporal evolution of a sequence of CDMs given all previously observed CDMs\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1). This reformulation appears designed to circumvent the imbalance issue by changing the prediction target.\n\n## Limitations in the Evidence\n\nThe evidence has several gaps:\n\n1. **Effectiveness Assessment**: While multiple solutions are mentioned, the evidence does not provide comparative evaluation of which approaches most effectively address class imbalance or whether any solution fundamentally solves the problem.\n\n2. **Detailed Implementation**: The specific techniques for \"artificially balancing the classes\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3) are not described in detail.\n\n3. **Quantitative Impact**: There is no quantitative analysis of how much the class imbalance degrades model performance or how much improvement the proposed solutions achieve.\n\n4. **Alternative Data Sources**: The evidence doesn't discuss whether synthetic data generation or other data augmentation approaches were considered to address the imbalance.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nuriot2022 — Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge (2022)\n\nacciarini2021 — Kessler: Machine Learning for Spacecraft Collision Avoidance (2021)\n\nmashiku2025 — Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks in Machine Learning for Collision Avoidance (2025)\n\ncatulo2023 — Bayesian Hidden Markov Models for Collision Avoidance (2023)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2579, "output_tokens": 921}}}

When making predictions, BNNs perform multiple samplings of weight and bias values, with the uncertainty arising from the spread in these parameter samples. A wider posterior distribution indicates higher uncertainty, while a narrower distribution indicates lower uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3).\n\n## Performance and Advantages of BNNs\n\nThe evidence indicates that **BNNs show the most promise** among the methods discussed. Quantification of risk and uncertainty tolerance can support improved performance of AI/ML tools for prediction and classification compared with standard neural network (SNN) approaches. In both case studies examined, better prediction and classification performance was observed when using methods that account for uncertainty quantification, though the authors note this is not a universal statement (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6).\n\nBNNs are specifically identified as preferable to SNNs under three conditions: when uncertainty is a necessary output, when there are limited available training data, and when detection of outlier predictions is important to flag for an operator (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6).\n\nA particularly valuable feature for operational deployment is that BNNs can express when they are ingesting out-of-distribution data from their training set, producing high-uncertainty estimates that could serve as alert flags (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec4.5.1_p1).\n\n## Operational Deployment Considerations\n\nFor operational deployment, the DoD should continue to consider the value of uncertainty quantification methodologies when developing and deploying operational AI/ML tools. These methodologies have potential to improve decision-making, risk management, model selection and optimization, and robustness (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10). However, challenges exist due to the complexities of these models and their computational overhead requirements, requiring AI/ML practitioners to be knowledgeable of these trade-offs (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).\n\nThe evidence also recommends that SDA operators should be trained to use the uncertainty quantification provided by these methodologies (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p5).\n\n## Supporting Evidence from Other Studies\n\nOne study examining uncertainty techniques mentions using calibration scores and prediction error as selection criteria for models (licata2022, sec8_p1), though specific methods are not detailed in the provided chunk.\n\nAnother study found that uncertainty values were generally higher for misclassified events in high-risk scenarios, suggesting value in building models that incorporate uncertainties at inference time by outputting risk distributions instead of point predictions (uriot2022, sec5.4_p2).\n\n## Information Gaps\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Detailed comparisons with other specific uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble methods, conformal prediction)\n- Quantitative performance metrics comparing different uncertainty quantification approaches\n- Specific computational overhead measurements or timing comparisons\n- Details about the \"two uncertainty techniques\" mentioned in the CHAMP model study (licata2022, sec8_p1)\n- Real-world operational deployment results or case studies\n\nTo fully answer which methods show the most promise for operational deployment, additional sources providing comparative benchmarking studies, computational performance data, and operational implementation experiences would be valuable.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nlicata2022 — CHAMP Model (2022)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 — [Title not provided in evidence] (2024)\nuriot2022 — [Title not provided in evidence] (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2144, "output_tokens": 900}}}

The evidence chunks provided do not contain explicit statements from these organizations explaining barriers to operational deployment of ML systems.\n\nHowever, the evidence does reveal some challenges and limitations in the ML collision avoidance domain:\n\n## Identified Challenges\n\n**Dataset Imbalance Issues**: The ESA Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge highlighted that \"several challenges, mostly derived from the unavoidable unbalanced nature of the dataset, had to be accounted for to release the dataset in the form of a competition and the use of automated, off-the-shelf ML pipelines were limited\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1).

This tracking gap represents a baseline limitation that affects any system, ML-based or otherwise.\n\n**Future Potential Rather Than Current Operational Status**: The evidence suggests ML is viewed as having future potential rather than current operational capability.

In the ESA collision avoidance challenge dataset, there are only 365 high-risk conjunctions (2.77%) compared to 12,789 low-risk events (97.23%), with 63.5% of all conjunction events having a final risk of -30 (representing false alerts) (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This severe imbalance is explicitly identified as \"the main challenge in collision risk estimation using ML methods\" (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\nThe rarity problem is further compounded by the nature of the data itself: \"the rarity of actual collision events in the historical dataset created a severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to train supervised learning models that could accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n## Training Challenges\n\nThe scarcity of high-risk events directly impacts model learning capacity. In experimental simulations with small training sets (test size of 0.95), training sets contained merely 523.0 events with only 10.8 high-risk cases (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9). With such \"insufficient data to learn from, the models quickly overfit and failed to learn generalizable rules,\" resulting in a mean 12.61% performance gain on training data but a 7.73% mean loss on test data relative to baseline (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\nRecognizing this challenge, 65% of competition participants attempted to explicitly address class imbalance through approaches such as \"artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n## Validation and Generalization Challenges\n\nThe rarity of collision events severely complicates validation set construction. Half of competition participants attempted to build validation sets with similar properties and risk distribution as the test set but failed, with \"most surveyed teams lamented a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\nThe validation problem is exacerbated by the non-random sampling strategy employed. The training and test sets were \"not randomly sampled from the dataset,\" with \"events corresponding to useful operational scenarios\" appearing in the test set (uriot2022, sec4.2_p2). This design choice, while operationally motivated, further complicated the validation challenge.\n\nWhen test sets were small (test size of 0.05), they contained approximately 523.0 events with only 10.8 high-risk cases, making the test set \"no longer representative\" (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9). Performance evaluation became highly variable depending on \"the 'predictability' of events that ended up on the test set,\" yielding a mean gain of only 0.04% with a standard deviation of 9.83% (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\n## Ground Truth Data Limitations\n\nThe fundamental challenge of limited verified collision data is acknowledged: \"While comprehensive collision datasets remain limited, the theoretical assessment of close conjunction events characterized by non-zero miss distances provides a viable foundation for evaluating the operational validity of AI/ML implementation\" (mashiku2025, sec2_p5). This statement suggests that the field must rely on theoretical assessments of near-misses rather than actual collision data for training and validation.\n\n## Interaction with Other Failure Modes\n\nThe rarity problem interacts with other characteristics of the data to compound difficulties. The \"stochastic and non-linear nature of the conjunction evolution created inconsistent parameter behavior patterns that were difficult for machine learning models to capture reliably,\" with \"sample cases generated from the same baseline often exhibited completely different behavioral patterns, undermining the assumption that historical patterns could reliably predict future conjunction evolution\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n## Optimal Trade-offs\n\nThe experiments revealed that optimal performance required balancing training data quantity with test set representativeness, with \"the optimal trade-off lay in a test size of 0.2, where a 6.45% gain in the training set performance over the LRP baseline translated into a 1.12% gain in the test set\" (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\n---\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\ncatulo2023 — Data Analysis (2023)\nmashiku2025 — Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks; Satellite C - Maneuverable Asset Response; Identification of Parameters Associated with High-Risk Events (2025)\nuriot2022 — Survey; Post Competition ML; Test and training sets; Simulating 10,000 virtual competitions; Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2666, "output_tokens": 1125}}}

For example, a 10% error in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light prediction can result in more than 200 km uncertainty for a given satellite after 7 days [107]."}, {"id": "precise_orbit_ml2024::sec1.2_p2", "source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.2_p2", "section_title": "Contributions", "year": 2024, "authors": "Francisco Caldas, Claudia Soares", "distance": 0.38704991340637207, "rerank_score": null, "text": "To summarize, this paper presents: an advancement in orbit prediction by eliminating the reliance on a hybrid error-correction method; the integration of exogenous variables to capture the effects of non-conservative forces; the testing in a real world setting with a data-centric approach; a machine learning model outperforming in error a J2 numerical propagator, using less compute time; and empirical validation of computational costs."}, {"id": "licata2022::sec0_p1", "source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "year": 2022, "authors": "Richard J.

Space weather originates from solar perturbations and is comprised of the resulting complex variations they cause within the numerous systems between the Sun and Earth. These systems are often tightly coupled and not well understood. This creates a need for skillful models with knowledge about the confidence of their predictions. One example of such a dynamical system highly impacted by space weather is the thermosphere, the neutral region of Earth's upper atmosphere. Our inability to forecast it has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations.

Continuing efforts are being made to improve model accuracy, but density models rarely provide estimates of confidence in predictions."}]}, "generation": {"answer": "# How Atmospheric Drag Uncertainty Propagates Through ML-Based Orbit Prediction Pipelines\n\n## Sources of Atmospheric Drag Uncertainty\n\nAtmospheric drag uncertainty originates from several compounding factors. Current approximate physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, which fail when considering space debris typically less than one meter in size. These failures stem from uncertainty around the initial state of the space object, forecasting errors in environmental conditions such as atmospheric drag, and unknown characteristics such as mass or geometry (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec0_p1).\n\nThe thermospheric density models that drive atmospheric drag calculations have inherent limitations. Empirical models that use space weather indexes for forecasting and estimating local density have a one-sigma accuracy of only 10-15%, depending on the model, solar activity, and location (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec5_p7). Furthermore, forecast errors in the driving features compound these problems—for example, a 10% error in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light prediction can result in more than 200 km uncertainty for a given satellite after 7 days (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec5_p7).\n\n## Propagation Through ML-Based Pipelines\n\nML-based orbit prediction attempts to address these uncertainties through several approaches. The orbit prediction process propagates the state of a Resident Space Object (RSO) until the time of closest approach (TCA) to any actively monitored satellite. Current limitations include the Gaussian assumption (which does not hold against the true distribution), simplified modeling of perturbation forces, unknown information regarding RSO characteristics, and uncertainty over space weather forecast data (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3).\n\nTraditional orbital prediction methods based on physical models are inaccurate with divergent errors due to challenges in modeling the atmosphere and acquiring physical information of specific spacecraft. Orbit decay predictions also depend on space environment information, which is hard to accurately predict (he2024, sec1_p4).\n\nML techniques have been proposed to mitigate these issues. One approach uses machine learning to determine ballistic coefficients of LEO spacecraft based on orbital data, which can minimize prediction errors stemming from uncertainties in drag coefficients and area-to-mass ratios (he2024, sec1_p4). Another method employed proximal policy optimization (PPO2) to adjust atmosphere model parameters, resulting in a maximum absolute space position error of 8133.329 m on the CSS in 3 days compared to standard orbital data (he2024, sec1_p4).\n\nRecent work has demonstrated that ML models can achieve approximately 11% errors on independent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for global models, and approximately 13% test error for local in-situ density datasets (licata2022, sec0_p2). Advanced ML techniques using Monte Carlo dropout and direct prediction of probability distributions with the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD) loss function have been developed to provide robust and reliable uncertainty estimates (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n## Downstream Effects on Collision Probability Estimates\n\nThe evidence provided does not directly detail how atmospheric drag uncertainty quantitatively affects collision probability calculations in ML-based systems. However, the NASA handbook addresses this issue for traditional methods: atmospheric density forecast error has been studied by comparing predicted densities (using predicted space weather indices) to actual densities and producing polynomial fits of the relative density error as a function of satellite perigee height and space weather indices. These fits produce a variance term that can be added to the ballistic coefficient variance in the covariance (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec16.7.1_p3).\n\nThe inability to forecast thermospheric density has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations. Even with perfect forecast of model drivers, incomplete knowledge of the system results in often inaccurate thermospheric neutral mass density predictions (licata2022, sec0_p1).\n\n## Information Gaps\n\nThe provided evidence does not contain specific quantitative analyses of:\n1. How uncertainty estimates from ML-based atmospheric density models propagate through the full orbit prediction pipeline to collision probability calculations\n2. Comparative studies showing collision probability accuracy differences between traditional and ML-based approaches\n3. Specific methodologies for incorporating ML-based uncertainty estimates into conjunction assessment workflows\n4. Statistical validation of collision probability estimates when using ML-predicted atmospheric densities versus traditional models\n\nAdditional sources needed would include studies on conjunction assessment with ML-based orbit predictions, specific collision probability calculation methodologies incorporating ML uncertainty quantification, and operational validation studies comparing collision warning accuracy between different approaches.\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nsurvey_ml_orbit2024 — Machine Learning for Orbit Determination and Orbit Prediction: A Survey (2024)\n\nlicata2022 — Machine Learning and Uncertainty Quantification for Thermospheric Density Prediction (2022)\n\nhe2024 — Machine Learning Techniques for Orbit Prediction (2024)\n\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 — NASA Collision Avoidance Handbook (2023)\n\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 — Precise Orbit Prediction Using Machine Learning (2024)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2840, "output_tokens": 1169}}}

To this question are two distinct responses: (1) First, within reasonable bounds, it makes sense to protect against safety-of-flight hazards that are known and that can, if necessary, be mitigated. NASA CARA's statement of purpose is \"to take prudent measures, at reasonable cost, to enhance safety of flight, without placing an undue burden on mission operations.\" An unjustified over-investment in safety should be avoided, and mission objectives should not be regularly and substantially impaired by conjunction assessment considerations. But since it is not particularly expensive or difficult to identify high-risk conjunctions from the existing space catalog, and since such conjunctions are relatively infrequent, and furthermore, since the need for mitigation action for such conjunctions is less than an order of magnitude less frequent than that, it is good safety practice to conduct conjunction assessment operations according to the CARA mission statement.

More specifically, this refers to generalization capability within the same dataset, where the total dataset is divided randomly into a training set and a testing set, with the testing data within the same time interval as the training set (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n**Type-II Generalization** is forecasting, which trains an algorithm to predict the future position of a space object beyond the training data timeframe (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1). This represents generalization capability to future epochs, where the testing data are restricted to be in the future epoch with respect to the training data, reflecting the realistic orbit prediction problem (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n**Type-III Generalization** extends ML capabilities to extrapolate information from one object to predict the orbit of a different space object (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1). More precisely, this is generalization capability to different but nearby RSOs (Resident Space Objects) in future epochs, which means learning patterns from a limited number of RSOs and then applying the knowledge onto other RSOs (peng2018, sec3_p1).

The recognition task in actual space imagery is highly complex because the sensing conditions are largely diverse. The conditions include various backgrounds affected by noise, several orbital scenarios, high contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, and various object sizes. To address the problem of space recognition, this paper proposes a multi-modal learning solution using various deep learning models. To extract features from RGB images that have spacecraft and debris, various convolutional neural network (CNN) based models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet were explored. Furthermore, RGB based vision transformer was demonstrated. Additionally, End-to-End CNN was used for classification of depth images. The final decision of the proposed solution combines the two decisions from RGB based and Depth-based models. The experiments were carried out using a novel dataset called SPARK which was generated under a realistic space simulation environment. The dataset includes various images with eleven categories, and it is divided into 150 k of RGB images and 150 k of depth images. The proposed combination of RGB based vision transformer and Depth-based End-to-End CNN showed higher performance and better results in terms of accuracy (85%), precision (86%), recall (85%), and F1 score (84%).

Rather, it is only predicting a fraction of a catastrophic collision (again, a result of averaging over 150 MC runs) in the first year. When the cumulative number of catastrophic collisions is plotted against time, as shown in Fig. 2, it is clear that what LEGEND predicts is one catastrophic collision by 2028. Another interesting point about the figure is the trend increases almost linearly with time in the next 200 years, although there is a slightly higher increase after 50 years (compared with the dotted reference line).

As large constellations continue to launch and the need for automation becomes more urgent, such automation must maintain the high reliability standards required for space operations (mashiku2025, sec6_p3).\n\n**Explainability Paradox**: The \"explainability\" paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches poses significant concerns for operational implementation, as conjunction assessment decisions require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Validation and Performance Challenges\n\n**Model Interpretability**: Significant additional work is needed to improve model interpretability before these methods could be considered for operational deployment (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n**Comprehensive Validation**: Machine learning techniques must demonstrate reliable performance via validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n**Uncertainty Quantification**: The research addresses the need for uncertainty quantification in AI/ML tools for both improving prediction and classification performance and mitigating potential AI/ML policy barriers, including facilitating operator-machine teaming and operator trust (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p3).\n\n## Operational Integration Constraints\n\n**Current Viability**: Fully automated AI/ML decision systems are not currently viable for operational risk assessment (mashiku2025, sec6_p3). While machine learning techniques showed theoretical promise for enhancing conjunction assessment capabilities, significant additional work would be needed to overcome these limitations (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n**Limited Scope for Implementation**: The research suggests that hybrid approaches combining traditional physics-based methods with targeted machine learning components may offer incremental improvements, such as identifying which conjunction events deserve analyst attention, rather than performing risk assessments and conclusive early decision-support for mitigative maneuver decisions (mashiku2025, sec6_p3). Future AI/ML approaches may find valuable niches within the broader conjunction assessment workflow, even if they cannot yet replace traditional physics-based methods entirely (mashiku2025, sec6_p4).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide specific details about:\n- Computational resource requirements or constraints\n- Integration challenges with existing systems and workflows\n- Specific policy or regulatory barriers beyond the general mention of \"AI/ML policy barriers\"\n- Cost considerations for ML implementation\n- Training requirements for operations personnel\n- Specific technical architectures or implementation approaches that were tested\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nmashiku2025 — Machine Learning for Conjunction Assessment (2025)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 — AI/ML for Space Domain Awareness (2024)\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 — NASA Conjunction Assessment Handbook (2023)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2018, "output_tokens": 836}}}

The dataset used in the ESA Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge is described as \"highly unbalanced\" with training and test sets not randomly sampled (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). More specifically, the dataset contains \"only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than −6\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1), making it \"extremely imbalanced\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**Impact on ML Approaches:**\nThe class imbalance challenge is characterized as \"unavoidable\" and derived from \"the unavoidable unbalanced nature of the dataset\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1). This imbalance was significant enough that \"the use of automated, off-the-shelf ML pipelines were limited\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1), indicating it posed a substantial barrier to straightforward ML application.\n\n**Performance Implications:**\nMost survey respondents \"lamented a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" when attempting to build validation sets with similar risk distributions to the test set (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3), suggesting the imbalance complicated model development and evaluation.\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Direct Class Imbalance Mitigation:**\nA majority (65%) of competition participants reported explicitly attempting to address class imbalance through approaches such as \"artificially balancing the classes\" or \"assigning importance weighing to samples\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**Data Filtering Strategy:**\nOne specific solution involved leveraging naive forecast predictions to filter the dataset. When naive forecast predicted a final risk value of −30, 99.34% of predictions were correct without misclassification of high-risk events (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).

This reformulation was motivated partly by the class imbalance issue inherent to binary classification approaches.\n\n**Validation Set Construction:**\nHalf of participants attempted to \"build a validation set with similar properties and risk distribution as the test set\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3), though this approach reportedly failed due to poor correlation between training and test performance.\n\n## Limitations in Evidence\n\nWhile the evidence clearly establishes class imbalance as a recognized barrier and documents several attempted solutions, it does not provide:\n- Quantitative comparisons of solution effectiveness\n- Detailed descriptions of the artificial balancing or importance weighting methods used\n- Success rates or performance improvements from the proposed solutions\n- Whether any solution was deemed sufficient for operational use\n\nThe evidence suggests that despite these solutions, the fundamental challenge remains unresolved for operational deployment, as \"AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nacciarini2021 — Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions (2021)\nuriot2022 — Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge (2022)\ncatulo2023 — ML in collision avoidance (2023)\nmashiku2025 — Future Directions and Conclusions (2025)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2626, "output_tokens": 939}}}

To this question are two distinct responses: (1) First, within reasonable bounds, it makes sense to protect against safety-of-flight hazards that are known and that can, if necessary, be mitigated. NASA CARA's statement of purpose is \"to take prudent measures, at reasonable cost, to enhance safety of flight, without placing an undue burden on mission operations.\" An unjustified over-investment in safety should be avoided, and mission objectives should not be regularly and substantially impaired by conjunction assessment considerations. But since it is not particularly expensive or difficult to identify high-risk conjunctions from the existing space catalog, and since such conjunctions are relatively infrequent, and furthermore, since the need for mitigation action for such conjunctions is less than an order of magnitude less frequent than that, it is good safety practice to conduct conjunction assessment operations according to the CARA mission statement.

More specifically, the dynamic factors influencing orbit decay—such as the space environment and spacecraft physical parameters—pose a challenge of catastrophic forgetting for conventional MLT (he2024, sec1_p6). This means that as ML models encounter new orbital conditions or spacecraft configurations, they tend to forget previously learned patterns, limiting their ability to generalize across different scenarios.\n\nDue to this phenomenon, current model-agnostic MLTs face limitations in terms of their generalization capabilities (he2024, sec1_p6). This is particularly problematic for orbit decay prediction because spacecraft operate in diverse and changing conditions that require models to maintain knowledge across multiple tasks or scenarios.\n\n## He 2024's Solution: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)\n\nTo address catastrophic forgetting, He et al. (2024) propose the Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (EODP), which employs a deep neural network (DNN) as the fundamental learner and incorporates the theory of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\nEWC is described as a regularization-based approach that combines historical and recent training data to update the neural network parameters by applying a penalty function (he2024, sec1_p6). The authors note that EWC is particularly suited for regression problems with abundant training data (he2024, sec1_p6), which aligns well with the orbit prediction domain where large amounts of orbital data are available.\n\nThe proposed EODP method is stated to overcome the negative effects of uncertain physical parameters and complex space environments, achieving at least a 70% improvement in accuracy compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP) (he2024, sec0_p1). Compared to previous methods, EODP greatly improves both prediction accuracy and generalization performance (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\n## Context: Alternative Approaches\n\nWhile He et al. focus on EWC, the evidence indicates that other strategies have been explored to enhance the generalization performance of neural networks, including optimization-based methods (like meta-learning) and replay-based techniques (such as experience replay) (he2024, sec1_p6). However, the choice of EWC appears driven by its suitability for regression problems with abundant training data, distinguishing it from meta-learning (which excels in few-shot learning) and experience replay (which efficiently utilizes limited sample sizes) (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 — Expandable orbit decay propagator for spacecraft PODP in VLEO (2024)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2737, "output_tokens": 671}}}

The recognition task in actual space imagery is highly complex because the sensing conditions are largely diverse. The conditions include various backgrounds affected by noise, several orbital scenarios, high contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, and various object sizes. To address the problem of space recognition, this paper proposes a multi-modal learning solution using various deep learning models. To extract features from RGB images that have spacecraft and debris, various convolutional neural network (CNN) based models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet were explored. Furthermore, RGB based vision transformer was demonstrated. Additionally, End-to-End CNN was used for classification of depth images. The final decision of the proposed solution combines the two decisions from RGB based and Depth-based models. The experiments were carried out using a novel dataset called SPARK which was generated under a realistic space simulation environment. The dataset includes various images with eleven categories, and it is divided into 150 k of RGB images and 150 k of depth images. The proposed combination of RGB based vision transformer and Depth-based End-to-End CNN showed higher performance and better results in terms of accuracy (85%), precision (86%), recall (85%), and F1 score (84%).

The research concluded that **significant advances in data collection, model interpretability, and validation methodologies would be required before machine learning techniques could be considered viable for operational conjunction assessment applications** (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3).\n\nA critical data challenge is the **limited availability of verified ground truth data, as comprehensive collision datasets remain limited**, though theoretical assessment of close conjunction events with non-zero miss distances can provide a foundation for evaluating ML operational validity (mashiku2025, sec2_p5).\n\n## Explainability Requirements\n\nThe **\"explainability\" paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches posed significant concerns for operational implementation, as conjunction assessment decisions require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome** (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). This need for explainability is emphasized as a requirement for **facilitating operator-machine teaming and operator trust** (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p3).\n\n## Validation and Performance Requirements\n\nMachine learning approaches **showed theoretical promise for enhancing conjunction assessment capabilities**, but **significant additional work would be needed to overcome stochastic data limitations, improve model interpretability, and demonstrate reliable performance via validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios before these methods could be considered for operational deployment** (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Operational Scope Limitations\n\nCurrent assessment indicates that **fully automated AI/ML decision systems are not currently viable for operational risk assessment** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3). The research suggests that ML may be better suited for **identifying which conjunction events deserve analyst attention, rather than performing risk assessments and conclusive early decision-support for mitigative maneuver decisions** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3).\n\n## Workload and Scaling Pressures\n\nThe operational context includes significant workload pressures. **Conjunction assessment workload is a function of: the total number of CDMs received, the number of events with risk levels requiring enhanced monitoring, and the number requiring mitigation planning and potential execution** (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec9_p1). As **large constellations continue to launch, the need for more sophisticated automation becomes increasingly urgent, but such automation must maintain the high reliability standards required for space operations** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3).\n\n## Data Integration Complexity\n\nAdditional operational difficulties arise from **receiving higher-level products from commercial vendors, such as vectors or even conjunction assessment outputs like CDMs, which introduces multiple solutions into the enterprise and creates significant operational difficulties in trying to adjudicate among them** (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec14.1_p2).\n\n## Future Path Forward\n\nThe research suggests that **hybrid approaches combining traditional physics-based methods with targeted machine learning components may offer incremental improvements** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3), and **by carefully constraining the problem domain and setting realistic expectations, future AI/ML approaches may yet find valuable niches within the broader conjunction assessment workflow, even if they cannot yet replace traditional physics-based methods entirely** (mashiku2025, sec6_p4).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nmashiku2025 — Findings and Challenges in ML for Conjunction Assessment (2025)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 — AI/ML for Space Domain Awareness Case Studies (2024)\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 — NASA Conjunction Assessment Handbook (2023)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2018, "output_tokens": 865}}}

However, as previously mentioned, the dataset is extremely imbalanced with only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than −6. To mitigate this problem a strategy is followed. It was verified that when the naive forecast predicts the final risk value of an event as −30 (the risk values are truncated at that lower bound), 99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events (after the removal of CDMs containing extreme outliers and parameters with impossible values). Thus, in this work, it is assumed that the −30 predictions by the naive forecast are trustworthy and, consequently, it is considered that those events do not require the application of ML models. So, those events are not used for training and, during the test phase, are directly predicted with a final risk of −30.

The discriminative binary-classification formulation of the problem (high- vs low-risk events) has been specifically criticized for \"training data class imbalance\" among other shortcomings (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n**Severity of Imbalance**: The dataset is described as \"extremely imbalanced with only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than −6\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). This extreme imbalance appears to be inherent to the operational reality of collision avoidance, where truly high-risk events are rare.\n\n**Impact on Model Performance**: The competition results revealed that \"the training and test sets not randomly sampled from the dataset\" contributed to difficulties, with \"most surveyed teams lamented a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). This suggests that the imbalanced nature of the data creates challenges in building generalizable models.\n\n**Operational Reliability Concerns**: The imbalance problem contributes to broader reliability concerns, with one source noting that \"AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed or implemented to address class imbalance:\n\n**1. Explicit Balancing Techniques**: A majority (65%) of competition participants \"explicitly attempted to address class imbalance (e.g., by artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples)\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**2. Generative Modeling Approach**: Rather than using discriminative classification, researchers have focused \"attention on the generative modeling of the problem\" to \"describe the temporal evolution of a sequence of CDMs given all previously observed CDMs\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1). This approach aims to sidestep some issues inherent in binary classification with imbalanced data.\n\n**3. Selective Training Strategy**: One documented solution involves filtering out the most obvious low-risk cases. Specifically, when the naive forecast predicts a final risk of −30, \"99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events,\" leading researchers to exclude these events from training and \"directly predicted with a final risk of −30\" during testing (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). This approach \"help[s] deal with the data imbalance problem\" while reducing computational requirements (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**4. Validation Set Construction**: Half of competition participants \"reported attempting to build a validation set with similar properties and risk distribution as the test set,\" though this approach largely failed (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**5.

To make predictions, the BNN samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters, yielding multiple predictions that reflect parameter uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3). A wider posterior distribution indicates higher uncertainty, while a narrower distribution indicates lower uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3).\n\n### Performance Comparison\n\nBNNs demonstrated superior performance compared to SNNs under specific conditions. Better prediction and classification performance was observed when using methods that account for uncertainty quantification, though this is not universally applicable (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6). BNNs are specifically preferable to SNNs when uncertainty is a necessary output, when there are limited available training data, and when the detection of outlier predictions is important to flag for an operator (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6).\n\n### Calibration Metrics\n\nOne study evaluated UQ approaches using calibration error scores, which measure the average absolute difference between expected and observed cumulative probability across all prediction intervals, with prediction intervals ranging from 5% to 95% with 5% increments plus 99% (licata2022, sec5.5_p1). Models were selected based on lowest prediction error and best calibration scores on validation sets (licata2022, sec8_p1).\n\n## Operational Deployment Considerations\n\n### Advantages for Operations\n\nUQ methodologies offer several operational benefits:\n\n1. **Risk-Based Decision Making**: Uncertainty quantification provides operators with the capability to set thresholds based on acceptable risk (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p5). Performance optimization curves can provide operators with insight into model discrimination performance, threshold selection, and trade-offs between operating conditions (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p5).\n\n2. **Improved Performance**: UQ can support improved performance of AI/ML tools focused on prediction and classification (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6). It has the potential to improve decision-making, risk management, model selection and optimization, and robustness (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).\n\n3. **Uncertainty-Aware Predictions**: Higher uncertainties were observed for misclassified events in conjunction assessment, suggesting potential value in building models that take uncertainties into account at inference time, for instance by outputting a risk distribution instead of a point prediction (uriot2022, sec5.4_p2).\n\n### Challenges for Operational Deployment\n\nDespite the promise, significant challenges exist:\n\n1. **Computational Overhead**: Using UQ algorithms may be challenging because of the complexities of these models and their computational overhead requirements (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10). AI/ML practitioners should be knowledgeable of these trade-offs when considering development of AI/ML tools (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).\n\n2. **Explainability Requirements**: The \"explainability\" paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches posed significant concerns for operational implementation, as conjunction assessment decisions require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n3. **Reliability Standards**: The comprehensive investigation revealed fundamental challenges that limited operational applicability for conjunction assessment, primarily due to stochasticity of data, complex orbital mechanics, and difficulty in achieving the high reliability and explainability standards required for high-value, high-risk space operations decision-making (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n4. **Additional Work Required**: While machine learning techniques with UQ showed theoretical promise, significant additional work would be needed to overcome stochastic data limitations, improve model interpretability, and demonstrate reliable performance via validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios before operational deployment (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Recommendations for Operational Deployment\n\nThe DoD should continue to consider the value of uncertainty quantification methodologies when developing and deploying operational AI/ML tools (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).

The traditional orbital prediction methods (TOPMs) based on physical models are inaccurate with divergent errors in PODP due to the challenges of modeling the atmosphere and acquiring the physical information of specific spacecraft [10]. Orbit decay with TOPM also depends on the information of space environment, which is hard to accurately predict. In recent years, several methods with machine learning techniques (MLTs) have emerged to enhance the capabilities of TOPM. Cimmino, Opromolla, and Fasano [11] used MLT to determine the ballistic coefficients of LEO spacecraft based on orbital data. This approach can minimize prediction errors stemming from uncertainties in drag coefficients and area-to-mass ratios. Lei and Zhang [12] employed another form of proximal policy optimization, PPO2, to adjust atmosphere model parameters to improve TOPM. Compared to standard orbital data, the proposed method resulted in a maximum absolute space position error of 8133.329 m on the CSS in 3 days. Peng and Bai [13] used an artificial neural network (NN) to compensate for TOPM errors. Compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP), the proposed approach significantly reduced residual errors. Li et al. [14] captured the error patterns to adjust the physical model with MLT based on historical prediction errors of space debris, which enhanced the capability of space situational awareness.

The effectiveness of the traditional orbital prediction method for PODP is limited by inaccurate estimation of the spacecraft's physical parameters and space environments. Generalization performance of machine learning techniques (MLTs) is blocked by the universal challenge known as catastrophic forgetting, resulting in limited improvement on PODP. In this study, a method of expandable orbit decay propagator (EODP) for spacecraft PODP in VLEO, based on model-agnostic MLTs, is proposed. The plasticity of the proposed model is discussed, which originates from the uncertainty of neural network (NN) parameters. The proposed method overcomes the negative effects of uncertain physical parameters and complex space environments.

Dataset Imbalance and Quality Issues**\n\nThe ESA Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge revealed that \"several challenges, mostly derived from the unavoidable unbalanced nature of the dataset, had to be accounted for\" and \"the use of automated, off-the-shelf ML pipelines were limited\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1).

Baseline Performance Competition**\n\nThe ESA competition demonstrated that \"naive forecasting models have surprisingly good performances and thus are established as an unavoidable benchmark for any future work in this subject\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1). This suggests that ML must prove significant advantage over simpler existing methods to justify operational deployment.\n\n**3. Fundamental Tracking Limitations**\n\nNASA notes a more fundamental challenge: approximately \"five-sixths of the objects large enough to leave a satellite in a failed and uncontrolled state if a collision should occur with them will be untracked,\" meaning \"greater than 85% of similarly likely collisions cannot be addressed at all\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec15.1_p3).

To mitigate this problem a strategy is followed. It was verified that when the naive forecast predicts the final risk value of an event as −30 (the risk values are truncated at that lower bound), 99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events (after the removal of CDMs containing extreme outliers and parameters with impossible values). Thus, in this work, it is assumed that the −30 predictions by the naive forecast are trustworthy and, consequently, it is considered that those events do not require the application of ML models. So, those events are not used for training and, during the test phase, are directly predicted with a final risk of −30. With this approach, a significant amount of low-risk conjunctions are removed, which can help deal with the data imbalance problem, and the volume of training data is reduced, resulting in lower memory requirements and a lower computational time."}, {"id": "uriot2022::sec6_p1", "source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Post Competition ML", "year": 2022, "authors": "Thomas Uriot, Dario Izzo, Luis F.

To infer the parameters of each model, current MCMC samplers require the evaluation of the log-likelihood density at each set of observations for each proposed set of parameters to be sampled. But, each event has a different number of CDMs, hence, to obtain the log probability of the model, it would be necessary to separately compute, in a loop, the logarithm of equation (4) for every set of observations of each event and then sum the result to obtain the joint log probability of the model. This would make the training of the model extremely slow and inefficient since this process would have to be repeated for every set of parameters to be sampled. A solution is to vectorize the sequences of CDMs and compute the log-likelihood density for each sequence at once and then sum the result. To vectorize the sequences of collision warnings, an approximation must be done regarding the data setup of the training set. Typically, in real collision events, 3 CDMs are released per day [7] during the week leading up to the TCA, where the latest CDM available is always considered the best knowledge about the outcome of the close approach. Thus, an approach to ensure that all input sequences (events) have the same number of observations (CDMs) is to verify whether 3 CDMs are received each day and, if less than 3 collision warnings are received, the latest CDM received is repeated until there are 3 on that day. If there are no CDMs received prior to that day, the first observation received is repeated. This process is done for all days during the week leading up to the TCA and, after this, the events that don't match the highest number of observations are, again, manipulated by repeating the first released CDM."}, {"id": "uriot2022::sec1.1_p3", "source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p3", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "year": 2022, "authors": "Thomas Uriot, Dario Izzo, Luis F.

The ESA Collision Avoidance Challenge dataset demonstrates this starkly: only 365 high-risk events (2.77%) exist compared to 12,789 low-risk events (97.23%) (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This imbalance makes it difficult to train supervised learning models that can accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). The problem is compounded by the fact that 63.5% of all conjunction events have a final risk of −30 (the lower truncation bound), representing false alerts (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\n## Training Data Manipulation Required\n\nTo mitigate the class imbalance, researchers must employ special strategies that affect how models are trained. One approach removes events where the naive forecast predicts a final risk of −30, since 99.34% of such predictions are correct without misclassifying high-risk events (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). While this reduces the data imbalance and computational requirements, it also means models are trained on a subset that doesn't fully represent operational reality.\n\n## Ground Truth Limitations\n\nThe scarcity of actual collisions creates validation challenges. Training AI/ML systems for Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) operations requires verified ground truth data, but \"comprehensive collision datasets remain limited\" (mashiku2025, sec2_p5). As a result, validation must rely on \"theoretical assessment of close conjunction events characterized by non-zero miss distances\" rather than actual collision outcomes (mashiku2025, sec2_p5).\n\n## Generalization Concerns\n\nThe rarity problem undermines fundamental assumptions about model generalization.

The atmosphere drag force, along with solar radiation pressure and RSO shape/attitude motion, is \"difficult to be accurately modeled\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p1). This modeling difficulty creates uncertainty that propagates through prediction systems in several ways.\n\nWhen performing orbit prediction, it is necessary to consider \"the impact of non-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of spacecraft and space debris alike\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec0_p1). Traditional methods like SGP4 \"inadequately account for these forces\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec0_p1), leading to prediction errors.\n\n## How ML Approaches Address Atmospheric Uncertainty\n\nML-based approaches attempt to mitigate atmospheric drag uncertainty through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Error Compensation**: ML models are designed to \"discover the hidden relationship between the available variables and the orbit prediction error from historical data\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p2), with the speculation that \"the effect of these unmodeled factors is hidden in the historical data\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p2).\n\n2. **Parameter Adjustment**: Some methods use ML techniques to \"determine the ballistic coefficients of LEO spacecraft based on orbital data\" to \"minimize prediction errors stemming from uncertainties in drag coefficients and area-to-mass ratios\" (he2024, sec1_p4). Others employ techniques to \"adjust atmosphere model parameters to improve\" traditional orbit prediction methods (he2024, sec1_p4).\n\n3. **Density Modeling**: \"Most machine learning in this area is focused on density estimation\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec6_p2), with models achieving \"errors of approximately 11% on independent test data\" for global density predictions (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n## Uncertainty Propagation Through ML Pipelines\n\nThe evidence describes how atmospheric uncertainty propagates through orbit prediction systems:\n\nCurrent limitations in orbit prediction include \"the simplified modeling of perturbation forces, the unknown information regarding RSO characteristics, and the uncertainty over space weather forecast data\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3). When an estimated state is propagated to a future epoch, it \"will further deviate from the true state because of the error propagation\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p1).\n\nThe problem is particularly acute because \"our inability to forecast it has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations\" (licata2022, sec0_p1). Even with \"perfect forecast of model drivers, our incomplete knowledge of the system results in often inaccurate thermospheric neutral mass density predictions\" (licata2022, sec0_p1).\n\n## Uncertainty Quantification in ML Systems\n\nRecent ML approaches recognize that \"uncertainty in the ML-OP scheme is necessary for industrial use\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec6_p2). Several techniques address this:\n\n- Bayesian approaches that \"predict a distribution\" are being explored, including methods that \"combined Gaussian Processes (GP) uncertainty with EKF-derived uncertainty\" and \"Deep Ensemble to perform variance estimation\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec6_p2).\n\n- Uncertainty-aware AI frameworks that predict covariance alongside state estimates have been developed, where \"the relative size of the predictive covariance is an indicator of how well this 'uncertainty-aware' AI approach understands a given RSO's orbit\" (vanslette2024, sec0_p1). This approach \"overtly predicts large amounts of uncertainty rather than silently producing wrong results\" in outlier situations (vanslette2024, sec0_p1).\n\n- Models using techniques like Monte Carlo dropout and \"direct prediction of the probability distribution\" provide \"well-calibrated uncertainty estimates\" (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n## Downstream Effects on Collision Probability\n\nRegarding specific downstream effects on collision probability estimates, the evidence is limited:\n\nThe evidence indicates that orbit prediction is \"essential to accurately track and predict debris and satellites' orbits\" to \"avert a chain reaction of collisions, known as Kessler Syndrome\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec0_p1).

Thus, for models to learn mission or object-specific rules, they would have to utilize features encoding relevant properties of that feature or object. It was hoped that this would force the model to learn more generalizable rules. In addition to this step, no other transformations were applied to the CDM raw values (such as scaling or embedding).

This information is crucial for maintaining the safety and sustainability of space operations, as it allows operators to monitor and predict the behaviour of objects in space, including potential collisions [9]."}, {"id": "massimi2024::sec2_p1", "source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Related Works", "year": 2024, "authors": "Federica Massimi, Pasquale Ferrara, Roberto Petrucci, Francesco Benedetto", "distance": 0.4722335934638977, "rerank_score": 1.4296194314956665, "text": "To mitigate the risks posed by space debris, it is essential to have accurate and up-to-date information on the location and trajectory of debris objects.

Phased Array Radar. This type of radar uses multiple antennas that can steer the beam in different directions without the need for any physical movement of the antenna itself. This allows for faster scanning of the sky and detection objects in multiple directions simultaneously. 2. Monostatic and Bistatic Radar. Monostatic radar uses a single antenna for both transmitting and receiving signals, while bistatic radar uses separate antennas. Bistatic radar can have better performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity, but it requires more hardware. 3. Multistatic radar involves multiple antennas for both transmitting and receiving signals. The antennas are distributed in different locations, creating a network of radar nodes that work together to detect and track targets. Multistatic radar offers enhanced coverage, increased system redundancy, and improved target detection capabilities. 4. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) uses a large antenna or multiple antennas that can be combined to create a virtual antenna that is much larger than the physical antenna. This allows for higher resolution imaging of objects in space. SAR systems use flexible orbits, frequent data acquisition, and Doppler effect adjustments to target extremely manoeuvrable targets. Certain systems employ sophisticated methods like multi-pass interferometry and moving target tracking along with tracking devices to pursue these kinds of targets. Target comprehension is enhanced by integration with additional sensors, and real-time processing is essential for applications that call for quick judgements."}, {"id": "massimi2024::sec1_p9", "source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p9", "section_title": "Introduction", "year": 2024, "authors": "Federica Massimi, Pasquale Ferrara, Roberto Petrucci, Francesco Benedetto", "distance": 0.5201269388198853, "rerank_score": -0.8161723017692566, "text": "The primary aim of this work is to present alternative and innovative methods for space debris detection using DL techniques.

This dataset was used in the Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge, which was an ML competition where participants had to build models to predict the final collision risk between orbiting objects. This paper describes the design and results of the competition and discusses the challenges and lessons learned when applying ML methods to this problem domain."}]}, "generation": {"answer": "Based on the provided evidence, **no single ML approach has been identified as definitively \"best\" for collision avoidance**.

This represents an extremely small fraction of high-risk events.\n\n## After Data Cleaning\n\nAfter data cleaning processes, one analysis reported 7,187 (99.3%) low-risk events and only 50 (0.7%) high-risk conjunctions (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2). This represents a ratio of approximately 144:1 (low-risk to high-risk).\n\n## Full Dataset Classification\n\nWhen classifying the full dataset using the risk threshold of -6 (where events with risk lower than -6 are considered low-risk), the dataset contained 12,789 low-risk events (97.23%) and 365 high-risk conjunctions (2.77%) (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).

Meta-learning seeks to achieve \"learning to learn,\" allowing NN to be flexible and adaptable in various scenarios, which has been utilized in the field of spacecraft terminal autonomous navigation and control [23–25]. Experience replay involves the creation of a small memory buffer to retain samples from previous tasks, allowing the NN to retain learned skills. This technique has been explored in spacecraft collision avoidance [26] and integrated scheduling [27]. The EWC combines historical and recent training data to update the NN parameters by applying a penalty function, commonly used to process large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets in the field of earth observation [28].

The traditional orbital prediction methods (TOPMs) based on physical models are inaccurate with divergent errors in PODP due to the challenges of modeling the atmosphere and acquiring the physical information of specific spacecraft [10]. Orbit decay with TOPM also depends on the information of space environment, which is hard to accurately predict. In recent years, several methods with machine learning techniques (MLTs) have emerged to enhance the capabilities of TOPM. Cimmino, Opromolla, and Fasano [11] used MLT to determine the ballistic coefficients of LEO spacecraft based on orbital data. This approach can minimize prediction errors stemming from uncertainties in drag coefficients and area-to-mass ratios. Lei and Zhang [12] employed another form of proximal policy optimization, PPO2, to adjust atmosphere model parameters to improve TOPM. Compared to standard orbital data, the proposed method resulted in a maximum absolute space position error of 8133.329 m on the CSS in 3 days. Peng and Bai [13] used an artificial neural network (NN) to compensate for TOPM errors. Compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP), the proposed approach significantly reduced residual errors. Li et al. [14] captured the error patterns to adjust the physical model with MLT based on historical prediction errors of space debris, which enhanced the capability of space situational awareness.

According to He et al., \"the dynamic factors influencing the decay, such as the space environment and spacecraft physical parameters, pose a challenge of catastrophic forgetting for conventional MLT\" (he2024, sec1_p6). This challenge specifically limits the generalization performance of machine learning techniques in precise orbit decay prediction (PODP), as \"generalization performance of machine learning techniques (MLTs) is blocked by the universal challenge known as catastrophic forgetting, resulting in limited improvement on PODP\" (he2024, sec0_p1).\n\nThe problem is particularly acute because current model-agnostic MLTs \"face limitations in terms of their generalization capabilities\" when dealing with the varying dynamic factors that affect orbit decay (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n## He 2024's Solution: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)\n\nTo address catastrophic forgetting, He et al. employ **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** as part of their Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (EODP) method. The authors note that \"EODP employs a deep NN (DNN) as the fundamental learner to comprehend the decaying rule and incorporates the theory of EWC\" (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\n### Why EWC Was Chosen\n\nThe choice of EWC was deliberate among several possible regularization-based approaches. The evidence indicates that while various strategies exist to enhance generalization performance—including \"optimization-based methods (like meta-learning), replay-based techniques (such as experience replay), and regularization-based approaches (like elastic weight consolidation [EWC])\"—each has specific advantages for different scenarios (he2024, sec1_p6). Specifically, \"EWC is particularly suited for regression problems with abundant training data\" (he2024, sec1_p6), which aligns well with the orbit decay prediction problem.\n\n### How EWC Works\n\nEWC addresses catastrophic forgetting by \"combin[ing] historical and recent training data to update the NN parameters by applying a penalty function\" (he2024, sec1_p6). This approach is \"commonly used to process large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets\" (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n## Results\n\nThe EODP method incorporating EWC achieved substantial improvements: \"The model achieves at least a 70% improvement in accuracy compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP) and presents a novel approach for the future implementation of machine learning–based methods in the field of orbit prediction\" (he2024, sec0_p1).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 — Very Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Orbit Decay Prediction Based on Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (2024)\n\npeng2018 — Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem (2018)\n\nsurvey_ml_orbit2024 — Survey of Machine Learning in Orbit Prediction (2024)\n\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 — Precise Orbit Prediction using Machine Learning (2024)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2827, "output_tokens": 750}}}

Understanding how to optimally leverage these technologies and planning for their expected impact on the SDA mission could potentially help improve mission effectiveness, optimize resource management, and inform investment decisions. This chapter provides an overview of the technologies, processes, and organizations that compose SDA operations at U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM), focusing on select current mission processes that provide context to the AI/ML case studies presented later in the report."}, {"id": "rand_ai_ssa2024::sec0_p2", "source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Summary", "year": 2024, "authors": "Jonathan Tran, Prateek Puri, Jordan Logue, Anthony Jacques, Li Ang Zhang, Krista Langeland, George Nacouzi, Gary J.

Training AI/ML systems for Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) operations requires access to verified ground truth data, but comprehensive collision datasets remain limited (mashiku2025, sec2_p5). This creates a bottleneck for developing reliable ML systems, as the research concluded that **significant advances in data collection** would be required before ML techniques could be considered viable for operational conjunction assessment applications (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3).\n\n## Stochasticity and Reliability Issues\n\nNASA found that ML approaches face **fundamental challenges due to the stochasticity of the data and the complex and stochastic nature of orbital mechanics** (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). This stochastic nature limited the operational applicability of machine learning approaches. The research highlighted that while ML techniques showed theoretical promise, **significant additional work would be needed to overcome stochastic data limitations** and demonstrate reliable performance across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Explainability Requirements\n\nA critical operational challenge is the **\"explainability\" paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches**, which posed significant concerns for operational implementation (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). Conjunction assessment decisions are high-stakes and require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome. The difficulty in achieving the **high reliability and explainability standards required for a high-value, high-risk space operations decision-making paradigm** was identified as a primary limitation (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Validation and Model Interpretability\n\nNASA identified that **advances in model interpretability and validation methodologies** would be essential prerequisites (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3). ML models must demonstrate reliable performance via validation across diverse operational scenarios before operational deployment can be considered (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Scope of Implementation\n\nThe research suggests that future ML approaches must be **carefully constrained in problem domain with realistic expectations**. While ML may find valuable niches within the broader conjunction assessment workflow, the evidence indicates these tools **cannot yet replace traditional physics-based methods entirely** (mashiku2025, sec6_p4).\n\n---\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\nmashiku2025 — [Title not provided in evidence] (2025)\n\nrand_ai_ssa2024 — [Title not provided in evidence] (2024)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2300, "output_tokens": 576}}}

To mitigate this problem a strategy is followed. It was verified that when the naive forecast predicts the final risk value of an event as −30 (the risk values are truncated at that lower bound), 99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events (after the removal of CDMs containing extreme outliers and parameters with impossible values). Thus, in this work, it is assumed that the −30 predictions by the naive forecast are trustworthy and, consequently, it is considered that those events do not require the application of ML models. So, those events are not used for training and, during the test phase, are directly predicted with a final risk of −30.

This was recognized as sufficiently problematic that 65% of competition participants explicitly attempted to address class imbalance (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**Rarity of High-Risk Events**: The dataset exhibits \"extreme\" imbalance, with \"only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than −6\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). More fundamentally, \"the rarity of actual collision events in the historical dataset created a severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to train supervised learning models that could accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n**Documented Impact on Model Training**: The class imbalance problem is explicitly identified as one of the \"shortcomings\" of approaching collision avoidance as a \"discriminative binary-classification formulation in ML (i.e., high- vs low-risk events)\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nThe evidence documents several approaches to address class imbalance:\n\n**1. Direct Balancing Techniques**: Survey results show that 65% of participants \"attempted to address class imbalance (e.g., by artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples)\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). However, specific details about which techniques were most effective are not provided in the evidence.\n\n**2. Strategic Data Filtering**: One approach involved removing extremely low-risk events from training. Specifically, events where the naive forecast predicted a final risk of −30 were excluded from training data, since \"99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events\" for such cases (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). This approach \"can help deal with the data imbalance problem, and the volume of training data is reduced, resulting in lower memory requirements and a lower computational time\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**3. Shift from Discriminative to Generative Modeling**: Rather than treating the problem as binary classification (high-risk vs. low-risk), researchers proposed \"focus[ing] our attention on the generative modeling of the problem, in other words we would like to deliver ML methods that describe the temporal evolution of a sequence of CDMs given all previously observed CDMs\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1). This represents a fundamental reframing of the problem to avoid class imbalance issues inherent in classification approaches.\n\n**4. Alternative Risk Prediction Approaches**: Post-competition work included models that \"predict the final chaser position uncertainties for each event and used those predictions to compute the risk\" rather than directly classifying risk levels (catulo2023, sec1_p7).\n\n## Limitations in the Evidence\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Quantitative comparisons of different class imbalance mitigation strategies\n- Detailed implementation specifics for the balancing techniques used by competition participants\n- Success rates or performance metrics for the proposed solutions\n- Information about whether any solution fully resolved the class imbalance barrier\n\nThe evidence suggests that while class imbalance is widely recognized and various solutions have been attempted, the problem remains a fundamental challenge requiring continued research, as indicated by the post-competition investigations (uriot2022, sec6_p1) and ongoing work to develop alternative modeling approaches (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nacciarini2021 — Kessler: an open-source Python package for machine learning applied to collision avoidance (2021)\n\ncatulo2023 — Bayesian HMMs for collision avoidance (2023)\n\nmashiku2025 — Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks in ML for Collision Avoidance (2025)\n\nuriot2022 — Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge Analysis (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2579, "output_tokens": 998}}}

BNNs provide uncertainty estimates by performing predictions through sampling from the posterior distribution of model parameters, yielding multiple predictions that reflect parameter uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3). This approach can quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty sources (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.4_p1).\n\n**Standard Neural Networks (SNNs)** are compared as the baseline approach without inherent uncertainty quantification capabilities.\n\n## Comparative Performance\n\nThe evidence indicates that **BNNs show superior performance** when uncertainty quantification is required. Better prediction and classification performance was observed when using methods that account for uncertainty quantification compared with SNN approaches in case studies (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6). However, the authors note this is not a universal finding, as \"there may be instances where the reverse is possible\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6).\n\n## Operational Advantages of BNNs\n\nBNNs are identified as preferable to SNNs under specific operational conditions:\n- When uncertainty is a necessary output\n- When there are limited available training data\n- When detection of outlier predictions is important to flag for an operator (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6)\n\nA particularly valuable operational feature is that BNNs can identify out-of-distribution data by producing high-uncertainty estimates, which could serve as an alert flag for operators (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec4.5.1_p1).\n\n## Operational Deployment Challenges\n\nDespite their advantages, uncertainty quantification methods face implementation challenges. The evidence notes that using these algorithms \"may be challenging because of the complexities of these models and their computational overhead requirements\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10). AI/ML practitioners within DoD are advised to be knowledgeable of these trade-offs when considering development (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).\n\n## Supporting Evidence from Practice\n\nThe practical value of uncertainty quantification is supported by observational evidence: higher uncertainties were generally associated with misclassified events in conjunction assessment, suggesting that models incorporating uncertainty at inference time (such as outputting risk distributions instead of point predictions) may provide value (uriot2022, sec5.4_p2).\n\n## Model Selection and Evaluation\n\nThe evidence indicates that models incorporating uncertainty techniques were selected based on \"lowest prediction error and best calibration scores\" (licata2022, sec8_p1), though specific comparative results between different uncertainty quantification methods are not provided in the evidence.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe DoD is advised to \"continue to consider the value of uncertainty quantification methodologies when developing and deploying operational AI/ML tools\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10), with operators requiring training to use the uncertainty quantification provided by these methodologies (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p5).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Quantitative comparisons of specific uncertainty quantification methods beyond BNN vs. SNN\n- Details on other uncertainty quantification techniques (e.g., ensemble methods, Monte Carlo dropout)\n- Specific computational overhead measurements\n- Real-world operational deployment results\n- Comparative analysis of different BNN implementation approaches\n\nREFERENCES\n\nlicata2022 — CHAMP Model (2022)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 — AI/ML for Space Domain Awareness (2024)\nuriot2022 — Difficulty of samples analysis (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2144, "output_tokens": 873}}}

This fundamental imbalance was explicitly recognized as \"the main challenge in collision risk estimation using ML methods\" (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). Furthermore, 63.5% of all conjunction events had a final risk value of -30 (the truncation threshold), representing false alerts (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\nThe rarity of actual collision events creates \"a severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to train supervised learning models that could accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). This challenge is compounded by the limited availability of verified ground truth data, as \"comprehensive collision datasets remain limited\" (mashiku2025, sec2_p5).\n\n## Training Set Size and Generalization\n\nThe scarcity of high-risk events becomes critical when datasets are split for training and testing. In simulated competitions with a 95% test set split, training sets contained merely 523.0 events, of which only 10.8 were high-risk events (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9). With such \"insufficient data to learn from, the models quickly overfit and failed to learn generalizable rules,\" resulting in a 12.61% mean gain on training sets but a 7.73% mean loss on test sets relative to baseline performance (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\n## Validation Challenges\n\nThe rarity of collision events severely impacts validation set construction. Half of the competition participants reported attempting to build validation sets with similar properties and risk distribution to the test set, \"albeit failing since most surveyed teams lamented a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). This suggests that the small number of high-risk events makes it extremely difficult to create representative validation splits.\n\nWhen test sets were small (5% of data), they contained only 523.0 events with 10.8 high-risk cases, making them \"no longer representative\" (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9). This resulted in highly variable performance depending on which specific events ended up in the test set, with a mean gain of only 0.04% but a standard deviation of 9.83% (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\n## Compensatory Approaches\n\nRecognizing these challenges, 65% of competition participants explicitly attempted to address class imbalance through various approaches such as \"artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). However, the evidence does not indicate whether these compensatory approaches were successful.\n\n## Underlying Complexity\n\nBeyond simple numerical scarcity, the rarity problem is compounded by \"the stochastic and non-linear nature of the conjunction evolution\" which creates \"inconsistent parameter behavior patterns that were difficult for machine learning models to capture reliably\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). The temporal analysis revealed that \"sample cases generated from the same baseline often exhibited completely different behavioral patterns, undermining the assumption that historical patterns could reliably predict future conjunction evolution\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide specific quantitative metrics on:\n- How many actual collisions (as opposed to high-risk conjunctions) occurred in the dataset\n- Detailed performance comparisons between different class imbalance mitigation techniques\n- Long-term validation results from operational deployment of these models\n\n## REFERENCES\n\ncatulo2023 — Data Analysis (2023)\nmashiku2025 — Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks; Satellite C - Maneuverable Asset Response; Identification of Parameters Associated with High-Risk Events (2025)\nuriot2022 — Survey; Test and training sets; Simulating 10,000 virtual competitions; Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2666, "output_tokens": 1006}}}

Space weather originates from solar perturbations and is comprised of the resulting complex variations they cause within the numerous systems between the Sun and Earth. These systems are often tightly coupled and not well understood. This creates a need for skillful models with knowledge about the confidence of their predictions. One example of such a dynamical system highly impacted by space weather is the thermosphere, the neutral region of Earth's upper atmosphere. Our inability to forecast it has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations.

Current approximate physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, with failures usually due to \"uncertainty around the state of the space object at the beginning of the trajectory, forecasting errors in environmental conditions such as atmospheric drag, and unknown characteristics such as the mass or geometry of the space object\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec0_p1).\n\nThe uncertainty in atmospheric density modeling itself is substantial. Empirical density models have \"a one-sigma accuracy of 10%–15%, depending on the model, solar activity, and location\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec5_p7). More critically, \"a 10% error in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light prediction can result in more than 200 km uncertainty for a given satellite after 7 days\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec5_p7), demonstrating how forecast errors in driving features can significantly amplify position uncertainties.\n\n## Propagation Through ML Pipelines\n\nThe evidence describes how ML-based approaches attempt to address atmospheric drag uncertainty, though specific propagation mechanisms are not fully detailed. Traditional orbital prediction methods \"are inaccurate with divergent errors in PODP due to the challenges of modeling the atmosphere and acquiring the physical information of specific spacecraft\" (he2024, sec1_p4). ML techniques have been applied to improve density predictions—for example, models trained on the HASDM density database \"achieve errors of approximately 11% on independent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates\" (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\nRecent ML approaches integrate \"exogenous variables to capture the effects of non-conservative forces\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.2_p2) and have shown that \"past information can be leveraged to improve Orbit Prediction,\" with one method reducing \"OP error from 1.5 km/day to 0.1 km/day\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec4_p5).\n\n## Downstream Effects on Collision Probability\n\nThe evidence establishes a direct connection between orbit prediction uncertainty and collision avoidance but lacks specific quantification of how atmospheric drag uncertainty affects collision probability estimates. The orbit prediction process \"propagates the state of the RSO until the time of closest approach (TCA) to any actively monitored satellite\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3), and \"current limitations in Orbit Prediction are the Gaussian assumption – which does not hold against the true distribution – the simplified modeling of perturbation forces, the unknown information regarding RSO characteristics, and the uncertainty over space weather forecast data\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3).\n\nOne relevant finding indicates that atmospheric density forecast error can be incorporated into collision risk assessment: \"These fits produce a variance term that can be added to the ballistic coefficient variance in the covariance\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec16.7.1_p3), suggesting that density uncertainties are formally propagated through covariance matrices used in collision probability calculations.\n\nThe broader context emphasizes the stakes: \"Our inability to forecast it has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations\" (licata2022, sec0_p1).\n\n## Knowledge Gaps\n\n**The evidence is insufficient to fully answer how atmospheric drag uncertainty specifically propagates through ML-based orbit prediction pipelines and quantitatively affects collision probability estimates.** \n\nMissing information includes:\n1. Specific mathematical formulations of how ML models propagate density uncertainty through their predictions\n2. Quantitative relationships between atmospheric density errors and final collision probability estimates\n3. Comparative analysis of uncertainty propagation between traditional physics-based and ML-based approaches\n4. Case studies showing actual collision probability calculation variations due to atmospheric drag uncertainty in ML systems\n\nSources that might help would include: technical papers on ML-based covariance estimation, studies on uncertainty quantification in neural network orbit propagators, and operational analyses from conjunction assessment systems using ML components.\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 — Challenges and Methods in PODP (2024)\n\nlicata2022 — ML Techniques for Thermospheric Density Prediction with Uncertainty (2022)\n\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 — NASA Collision Avoidance Handbook (2023)\n\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 — Machine Learning for Precise Orbit Prediction (2024)\n\nsurvey_ml_orbit2024 — Survey of Machine Learning for Orbit Determination and Prediction (2024)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2840, "output_tokens": 1073}}}

As noted in [16], investigating Recurring Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM models to ingest time-series based information could eventually provide more reliable predictions at TCA, especially if approaches can be developed that incorporate uncertainty quantification in the predictions. Future studies should carefully consider that predictions of future measurement updates are nearly impossible to model deterministically since they are not entirely physics-based, and that routine maneuvers as part of normal operations are difficult or impossible to model or incorporate within a model.

This class imbalance issue specifically affects discriminative binary-classification formulations that attempt to distinguish between high- vs low-risk events (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n## Limited Applicability of Off-the-Shelf Solutions\n\nThe dataset characteristics **limited the use of automated, off-the-shelf ML pipelines** (uriot2022, sec7_p1), suggesting that standard ML approaches fail when directly applied to this domain without significant customization.\n\n## Shortcomings of Discriminative Classification Approaches\n\nApproaching the problem as discriminative binary-classification has **various shortcomings**, including not only the training data class imbalance mentioned above, but also **scarce interpretability of the output** (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n## Inability to Handle Non-Deterministic Updates\n\nA critical limitation is that **predictions of future measurement updates are nearly impossible to model deterministically since they are not entirely physics-based** (mashiku2025, sec6_p1). This represents a fundamental challenge where the updates don't follow purely physical laws.\n\n## Difficulty Modeling Operational Maneuvers\n\n**Routine maneuvers as part of normal operations are difficult or impossible to model or incorporate within a model** (mashiku2025, sec6_p1), creating gaps in what ML systems can effectively predict.\n\n## Insufficient Reliability for Operations\n\nMost significantly, **AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making** (mashiku2025, sec6_p1), indicating that current ML methods fail to meet the safety and reliability standards required for actual deployment.\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide detailed information about:\n- Specific false positive/false negative rates\n- Failure modes related to computational constraints or real-time performance\n- Issues with model generalization across different orbital regimes\n- Problems with handling sparse or missing data in CDM sequences\n\nREFERENCES:\n- uriot2022 — Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge (2022)\n- acciarini2021 — Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions (2021)\n- mashiku2025 — Future Directions and Conclusions (2025)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2521, "output_tokens": 556}}}

The problem is severe: datasets contain approximately 97.23% low-risk events and only 2.77% high-risk events (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). Additionally, 63.5% of conjunction events have a final risk of -30, representing false alerts (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\n## Training Process Complications\n\nThe class imbalance creates fundamental training difficulties. In the collision avoidance challenge, the training data consisted of 8293 CDMs, but notably there was \"absence of any steps to address the existing class imbalance and the absence of any focus on high-risk events during the training process\" (uriot2022, sec6.1_p3). Models were requested to learn risk evolution across the full range of risk values, yet they were \"mostly assessed on their performance at one end of the range of risk values during evaluation\" (uriot2022, sec6.1_p3).\n\nWhen datasets are small, the imbalance is even more pronounced. With a 95% test split, training sets had only 523.0 events, of which merely 10.8 were high-risk (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9). With insufficient high-risk examples, \"the models quickly overfit and failed to learn generalizable rules\" (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\n## Model Performance Issues\n\nThe class imbalance contributes to significant overfitting problems. Models exhibited \"a strong negative correlation: the better the performance on the training set, the worse it was on the test set. This was a clear sign of overfitting\" (uriot2022, sec6.1_p7). Most models degraded the risk estimate available in the most recent CDM, struggling to improve the Last Received Product (LRP) baseline (uriot2022, sec6.1_p7).\n\nThe aggregated loss metric displayed \"essentially no correlation\" between training and test performance, which \"offers a possible explanation for competitors' sentiment of disappointment over models that were good in their local training setups evaluating poorly on the leaderboard\" (uriot2022, sec6.1_p7).\n\n## Attempted Mitigation Strategies\n\nA total of 65% of participants attempted to address class imbalance explicitly through approaches such as artificially balancing classes or assigning importance weighting to samples (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). Half of participants tried to build validation sets with similar properties and risk distribution as the test set, but \"most surveyed teams lamented a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n## Data Split Complications\n\nThe imbalance problem is exacerbated by improper data splitting. When examining high-risk events specifically, missions were not well distributed between training and test sets because \"the dataset was randomly split into training and testing, considering only the risk value and not the mission type\" (uriot2022, sec4.5_p3). Certain missions were over-represented in the test set while others were under-represented (uriot2022, sec4.5_p3).\n\n## False Positive Problems\n\nClass imbalance contributes to false positive predictions. Models showed the same number of false negatives and true positives, but differed in false positive rates (catulo2023, sec5.1_p5). False positives originated from events that had risk values higher than the high-risk threshold before cut-off time and then experienced \"a significant jump toward lower values\" (catulo2023, sec5.1_p6). This \"highlights the complex and unpredictable behaviour of the risk updates within the events\" (catulo2023, sec5.1_p6).\n\n## Recommendations\n\nFuture improvements should focus on \"the development of weighted loss functions that address the class imbalance problem by giving higher importance to the rare high-risk events\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p2). However, this must be \"implemented carefully\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p2).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Quantitative comparisons of specific class balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE, class weights, focal loss)\n- Detailed metrics on how different imbalance ratios affect specific performance measures\n- Systematic studies comparing balanced vs. unbalanced training approaches\n- Information on optimal sampling strategies for this specific domain\n\n# REFERENCES\n\ncatulo2023 — [Title not provided in evidence] (2023)\n\nmashiku2025 — [Title not provided in evidence] (2025)\n\nuriot2022 — [Title not provided in evidence] (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2988, "output_tokens": 1083}}}

(2023) study, the initial dataset contained **12,789 low-risk events (97.23%) and only 365 high-risk conjunctions (2.77%)** (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This represents an approximate ratio of **35:1** (low-risk to high-risk).\n\n## After Data Cleaning\n\nAfter applying data cleaning procedures that removed 5,917 events and 44,399 CDMs, the same study reported the dataset contained **7,187 (99.3%) low-risk events and only 50 (0.7%) high-risk conjunctions** (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2). This represents an approximate ratio of **144:1** (low-risk to high-risk), showing a much more severe imbalance after cleaning.\n\n## Alternative Dataset\n\nA different dataset described by Uriot et al.

(r = 10⁻⁶), this would represent approximately **515 high-risk events out of 15,321 total events (3.4%)**, or a ratio of approximately **29:1**.\n\n## Significance\n\nBoth sources explicitly identify this class imbalance as a major challenge for ML approaches (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2; catulo2023, sec3.1_p3; uriot2022, sec6.1_p3).\n\n---\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\ncatulo2023 — Data Cleaning and Analysis for Collision Risk Assessment (2023)\n\nuriot2022 — Database of Conjunction Events and ML Performance Baseline (2022)", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "usage": {"input_tokens": 2953, "output_tokens": 544}}}
