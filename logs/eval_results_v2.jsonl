This represents an imbalance ratio of approximately **35:1** in favor of low-risk events.\n\n## After Data Cleaning (Catulo 2023)\n\nAfter data cleaning procedures, the dataset ended up with **7,187 (99.3%) low-risk events and only 50 (0.7%) high-risk conjunctions** (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2). This represents a more severe imbalance ratio of approximately **144:1** in favor of low-risk events.\n\n## Alternative Dataset (Uriot 2022)\n\nA different version of the dataset contained **15,321 total events**, with the number of high-risk events varying by threshold: **30 high-risk events (r \u2265 10\u207b\u2074), 131 high-risk events (r \u2265 10\u207b\u2075), and 515 high-risk events (r \u2265 10\u207b\u2076)** (uriot2022, sec3_p4). At the 10\u207b\u2076 threshold, this represents an imbalance ratio of approximately **30:1**.\n\n## Impact and Recognition\n\nThe evidence consistently identifies this imbalance as a fundamental challenge. One source notes that \"dealing with such imbalanced data poses to be the major challenge of this work\" (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2), while another states \"the data imbalance problem poses to be the main challenge in collision risk estimation using ML methods\" (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\ncatulo2023 \u2014 Data Cleaning and Analysis for Collision Risk Assessment (2023)\n\nuriot2022

However, the direct probability distribution prediction method has a much lower computational cost (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n## Other Methods Mentioned\n\nThe authors note that other methods exist for space weather applications, such as GP (Gaussian Process) regression and ensemble modeling, but these two techniques were considered a sufficient starting point (licata2022, sec10_p6).\n\n---\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\nlicata2022 \u2014 Thermospheric Density Modeling with Machine Learning and Uncertainty Quantification (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "[Untitled Introduction]", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3213620185852051, "rerank_score": 3.817256450653076}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec10_p1", "section_title": "Discussion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3635063171386719, "rerank_score": 2.6899235248565674}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "[Untitled Introduction]", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37500178813934326, "rerank_score": -0.27632927894592285}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec6_p4", "section_title": "Toy Problems", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37510019540786743, "rerank_score": -0.2777802348136902}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p6", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3833851218223572, "rerank_score": -2.478839874267578}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "SET HASDM Density Database", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3870531916618347, "rerank_score": -0.39549267292022705}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec10_p6", "section_title": "Discussion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39059019088745117, "rerank_score": 2.108184814453125}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39945125579833984, "rerank_score": 0.9373230338096619}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41255712509155273, "rerank_score": 2.598926305770874}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p8", "section_title": "HASDM Model", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4132235050201416, "rerank_score": -2.0756876468658447}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec14.1_p4", "section_title": "Use Raw Observation Data Only and Combine with SSN Observations for a Single Solution", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4271143078804016, "rerank_score": -7.9495134353637695}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec10_p3", "section_title": "Discussion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42948681116104126, "rerank_score": -0.45689690113067627}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p9", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45273786783218384, "rerank_score": -5.612997531890869}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec17.4.1_p5", "section_title": "Estimating the Masses of Unknown Objects", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4558364152908325, "rerank_score": -6.346103191375732}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p2", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45842087268829346, "rerank_score": -9.791362762451172}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p9", "section_title": "HASDM Model", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45986586809158325, "rerank_score": -4.903529167175293}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p3", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4629281163215637, "rerank_score": -7.279536247253418}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.7.1_p3", "section_title": "Input Covariance Data Considerations", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4669990539550781, "rerank_score": -5.263852119445801}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p8", "section_title": "Generation of Orbital Decay Training Set", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47153449058532715, "rerank_score": -3.009005546569824}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1.1_p1", "section_title": "Machine Learning", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47707605361938477, "rerank_score": 2.2672228813171387}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "[Untitled Introduction]", "text_preview": "Even with these improvements, density models have high errors, and we generally use them without any knowledge of their confidence given the conditions.

More specifically, the total dataset is divided randomly into training and testing sets, where the testing data are within the same time interval as the training set, which is common practice in the machine learning area (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n**Type II: Generalization capability to future epochs (forecasting)**\nThis type trains an algorithm to predict the future position of a space object beyond the training data timeframe (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1). The testing data are restricted to be in the future epoch with respect to the training data, which reflects the realistic orbit prediction problem (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n**Type III: Generalization capability to different but nearby RSOs in future epochs**\nThis extends ML capabilities to extrapolate information from one object to predict the orbit of a different space object (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1). This capability means learning patterns from a limited number of RSOs (Resident Space Objects), and then applying the knowledge onto other RSOs, which can be very important for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\n## REFERENCES\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 \u2014 Related Work (2024)\npeng2018 \u2014 Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction (2018)", "retrieved_chunks":

More specifically, the dynamic factors influencing orbit decay\u2014such as the space environment and spacecraft physical parameters\u2014pose a challenge of catastrophic forgetting for conventional MLT (he2024, sec1_p6). This means that as ML models encounter new orbital conditions or spacecraft configurations, they tend to forget previously learned patterns, limiting their ability to generalize across different scenarios.\n\nDue to this phenomenon, current model-agnostic MLTs face limitations in terms of their generalization capabilities (he2024, sec1_p6). This is particularly problematic for orbit decay prediction because spacecraft operate in diverse and changing conditions that require models to maintain knowledge across multiple tasks or scenarios.\n\n## He 2024's Solution: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)\n\nTo address catastrophic forgetting, He et al. (2024) propose the Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (EODP), which employs a deep neural network (DNN) as the fundamental learner and incorporates the theory of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\nEWC is described as a regularization-based approach that combines historical and recent training data to update the neural network parameters by applying a penalty function (he2024, sec1_p6). The authors note that EWC is particularly suited for regression problems with abundant training data (he2024, sec1_p6), which aligns well with the orbit prediction domain where large amounts of orbital data are available.\n\nThe proposed EODP method is stated to overcome the negative effects of uncertain physical parameters and complex space environments, achieving at least a 70% improvement in accuracy compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP) (he2024, sec0_p1). Compared to previous methods, EODP greatly improves both prediction accuracy and generalization performance (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\n## Context: Alternative Approaches\n\nWhile He et al. focus on EWC, the evidence indicates that other strategies have been explored to enhance the generalization performance of neural networks, including optimization-based methods (like meta-learning) and replay-based techniques (such as experience replay) (he2024, sec1_p6). However, the choice of EWC appears driven by its suitability for regression problems with abundant training data, distinguishing it from meta-learning (which excels in few-shot learning) and experience replay (which efficiently utilizes limited sample sizes) (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 \u2014 Expandable orbit decay propagator for spacecraft PODP in VLEO (2024)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.30898362398147583, "rerank_score": 2.7215545177459717}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37473487854003906, "rerank_score": -0.22746551036834717}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3748103380203247, "rerank_score": -1.6608076095581055}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p5", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3851904273033142, "rerank_score": -4.526657581329346}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3952840566635132, "rerank_score": -1.2456574440002441}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.397912859916687, "rerank_score": 1.801713466644287}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Related Work", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4061458706855774, "rerank_score": 0.6112939715385437}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41107672452926636, "rerank_score": 0.9697009325027466}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4136850833892822, "rerank_score": -2.292809009552002}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3_p1", "section_title": "Generalization Capability at Future Epochs", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4201139807701111, "rerank_score": -3.5804946422576904}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Backgrounds", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42599672079086304, "rerank_score": -4.009028911590576}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42932993173599243, "rerank_score": -3.819114923477173}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p11", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4304888844490051, "rerank_score": -0.7458943724632263}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.2_p2", "section_title": "Contributions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4310171604156494, "rerank_score": -4.639530181884766}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p8", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43301182985305786, "rerank_score": -3.531742572784424}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43428951501846313, "rerank_score": -2.2864880561828613}, {"source_id": "esa_environment2025", "chunk_id": "sec6.1_p6_1", "section_title": "End-Of-Life Operations in Low Earth Orbit", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.44218289852142334, "rerank_score": -6.5440673828125}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.3_p3", "section_title": "Description of EODP", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4459379315376282, "rerank_score": -8.065677642822266}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4466515779495239, "rerank_score": -8.24454402923584}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p1", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45193910598754883, "rerank_score": -3.1165080070495605}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "Very low earth orbit (VLEO) spacecraft have become an attractive proposition with obvious advantages in various missions, including communication and ground observation.

The research concluded that **significant advances in data collection, model interpretability, and validation methodologies would be required before machine learning techniques could be considered viable for operational conjunction assessment applications** (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3).\n\nA critical data challenge is the **limited availability of verified ground truth data, as comprehensive collision datasets remain limited**, though theoretical assessment of close conjunction events with non-zero miss distances can provide a foundation for evaluating ML operational validity (mashiku2025, sec2_p5).\n\n## Explainability Requirements\n\nThe **\"explainability\" paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches posed significant concerns for operational implementation, as conjunction assessment decisions require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome** (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). This need for explainability is emphasized as a requirement for **facilitating operator-machine teaming and operator trust** (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p3).\n\n## Validation and Performance Requirements\n\nMachine learning approaches **showed theoretical promise for enhancing conjunction assessment capabilities**, but **significant additional work would be needed to overcome stochastic data limitations, improve model interpretability, and demonstrate reliable performance via validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios before these methods could be considered for operational deployment** (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Operational Scope Limitations\n\nCurrent assessment indicates that **fully automated AI/ML decision systems are not currently viable for operational risk assessment** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3). The research suggests that ML may be better suited for **identifying which conjunction events deserve analyst attention, rather than performing risk assessments and conclusive early decision-support for mitigative maneuver decisions** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3).\n\n## Workload and Scaling Pressures\n\nThe operational context includes significant workload pressures. **Conjunction assessment workload is a function of: the total number of CDMs received, the number of events with risk levels requiring enhanced monitoring, and the number requiring mitigation planning and potential execution** (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec9_p1). As **large constellations continue to launch, the need for more sophisticated automation becomes increasingly urgent, but such automation must maintain the high reliability standards required for space operations** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3).\n\n## Data Integration Complexity\n\nAdditional operational difficulties arise from **receiving higher-level products from commercial vendors, such as vectors or even conjunction assessment outputs like CDMs, which introduces multiple solutions into the enterprise and creates significant operational difficulties in trying to adjudicate among them** (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec14.1_p2).\n\n## Future Path Forward\n\nThe research suggests that **hybrid approaches combining traditional physics-based methods with targeted machine learning components may offer incremental improvements** (mashiku2025, sec6_p3), and **by carefully constraining the problem domain and setting realistic expectations, future AI/ML approaches may yet find valuable niches within the broader conjunction assessment workflow, even if they cannot yet replace traditional physics-based methods entirely** (mashiku2025, sec6_p4).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nmashiku2025 \u2014 Findings and Challenges in ML for Conjunction Assessment (2025)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 \u2014 AI/ML for Space Domain Awareness Case Studies (2024)\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 \u2014 NASA Conjunction Assessment Handbook (2023)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p3", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.25881367921829224, "rerank_score": 3.537935256958008}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C -

Challenges with generalization and artifact generation.", "use_reranker": true, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "answer": "# ML Approaches Used by MOCAT-ML\n\nMOCAT-ML employed several deep learning-based approaches to predict anthropogenic space object (ASO) density distributions:\n\nThe framework utilized **multiple neural network architectures**, ranging from autoencoders to recurrent neural networks and transformers (mocat_ml2024, sec1_p3). These approaches were specifically designed to predict ASO density distributions over the phase space of orbital elements and the area-to-mass ratio (A/m) (mocat_ml2024, sec1_p3). The model was trained on hundreds of simulations generated by MOCAT-MC, an established and accurate Monte Carlo model (mocat_ml2024, sec0_p1).\n\nThe density distributions were represented over the area-to-mass ratio and perigee phase space, with A/m discretized into 99 evenly distributed bins on a log-scale (from 10^-5 m\u00b2/kg to 10^1 m\u00b2/kg) and perigee discretized into 36 bins of 50 km in height, from 200 km to 2,000 km altitudes (mocat_ml2024, sec3_p3).\n\n# Challenges with Long-Term Forecasting\n\nThe researchers encountered several challenges when conducting long-term forecasting:\n\n1. **Performance Degradation Over Time**: When conducting experiments in long-term forecasting scenarios (around 100 years), the researchers analyzed how and why the performance degrades over time (mocat_ml2024, sec0_p1). However, the specific mechanisms of this degradation are not detailed in the provided evidence.\n\n2. **Generalization Concerns**: A significant challenge was ensuring the model's generalizability. All training and test simulations belonged to one single scenario (with an initial population and launch rate multiplied by a factor of 15), and the model needed to be tested on different scenarios to ensure it learns the actual dynamics of space environment evolution rather than simply \"memorizing\" an optimal encoding to reproduce Monte Carlo simulations (mocat_ml2024, sec6_p4).\n\n3. **Hybrid Approach Necessity**: To address accuracy limitations in long-term predictions, the researchers proposed a hybrid approach where initial epochs of propagation are provided by traditional methods like MOCAT-MC, with subsequent predictions enhanced by the ML model (mocat_ml2024, sec7_p4). This suggests that the ML model alone was insufficient for maintaining accuracy across the full forecast horizon.\n\nThe evidence does not provide specific details about the magnitude of performance degradation, the exact failure modes encountered, or quantitative metrics of long-term forecasting accuracy. Additionally, no information is provided about uncertainty quantification methods used in MOCAT-ML, though such methods are discussed in a separate space weather context (licata2022, sec5.4_p1).\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nmocat_ml2024 \u2014 MOCAT-ML: Machine Learning-based Space Environment Modeling (2024)\n\nlicata2022 \u2014 Machine Learning Thermospheric Density Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p3", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.30605340003967285, "rerank_score": 6.308801651000977}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p4", "section_title": "Perspectives", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3085048198699951, "rerank_score": 1.5309909582138062}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3123990297317505, "rerank_score": 5.149864196777344}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3155667781829834, "rerank_score": 3.876554012298584}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p4", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3303542137145996, "rerank_score": 2.506009101867676}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec3_p2", "section_title": "Dataset", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.34914255142211914, "rerank_score": -1.2177674770355225}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3787400722503662, "rerank_score": 3.8693325519561768}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38170087337493896, "rerank_score": 1.1545886993408203}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec3_p3", "section_title": "Dataset", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38698452711105347, "rerank_score": 2.0887699127197266}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39199310541152954, "rerank_score": -0.274755597114563}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39475083351135254, "rerank_score": 3.841069459915161}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p12", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4060509204864502, "rerank_score": -4.784865856170654}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p5", "section_title": "Future Challenges and Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.40964794158935547, "rerank_score": 0.8734886646270752}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41352248191833496, "rerank_score": -3.973905086517334}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec3_p1", "section_title": "Dataset", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42418599128723145, "rerank_score": -2.2701704502105713}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p7", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42512238025665283, "rerank_score": -1.7370307445526123}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.4_p1", "section_title": "Uncertainty Quantification", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4304581880569458, "rerank_score": 1.4150904417037964}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4312617778778076, "rerank_score": -0.5533288717269897}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p13", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4318774342536926, "rerank_score": -1.8242850303649902}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p2", "section_title": "Future Challenges and Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4333183765411377, "rerank_score": -0.5127964019775391}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p3", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "The implications of this study are far-reaching.

The discriminative binary-classification formulation of the problem (high- vs low-risk events) has been specifically criticized for \"training data class imbalance\" among other shortcomings (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n**Severity of Imbalance**: The dataset is described as \"extremely imbalanced with only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than \u22126\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). This extreme imbalance appears to be inherent to the operational reality of collision avoidance, where truly high-risk events are rare.\n\n**Impact on Model Performance**: The competition results revealed that \"the training and test sets not randomly sampled from the dataset\" contributed to difficulties, with \"most surveyed teams lamented a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). This suggests that the imbalanced nature of the data creates challenges in building generalizable models.\n\n**Operational Reliability Concerns**: The imbalance problem contributes to broader reliability concerns, with one source noting that \"AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed or implemented to address class imbalance:\n\n**1. Explicit Balancing Techniques**: A majority (65%) of competition participants \"explicitly attempted to address class imbalance (e.g., by artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples)\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**2. Generative Modeling Approach**: Rather than using discriminative classification, researchers have focused \"attention on the generative modeling of the problem\" to \"describe the temporal evolution of a sequence of CDMs given all previously observed CDMs\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1). This approach aims to sidestep some issues inherent in binary classification with imbalanced data.\n\n**3. Selective Training Strategy**: One documented solution involves filtering out the most obvious low-risk cases. Specifically, when the naive forecast predicts a final risk of \u221230, \"99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events,\" leading researchers to exclude these events from training and \"directly predicted with a final risk of \u221230\" during testing (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). This approach \"help[s] deal with the data imbalance problem\" while reducing computational requirements (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**4. Validation Set Construction**: Half of competition participants \"reported attempting to build a validation set with similar properties and risk distribution as the test set,\" though this approach largely failed (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**5. Alternative Prediction Targets**: Some researchers have explored \"predict[ing] the final chaser position uncertainties for each event and used those predictions to compute the risk\" rather than directly predicting risk (catulo2023, sec1_p7).\n\n## Limitations in Evidence\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Quantitative comparisons of the effectiveness of different balancing approaches\n- Detailed analysis of why validation set construction attempts failed\n- Specific technical details on artificial balancing or importance weighting methods used\n- Long-term operational results demonstrating whether any solution has achieved production-level reliability\n\nThe evidence suggests that while class imbalance is recognized as a fundamental barrier and various solutions have been attempted, no approach has yet produced ML systems reliable enough for operational deployment (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nacciarini2021 \u2014 Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions (2021)\nuriot2022 \u2014 Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge (2022)\ncatulo2023 \u2014 ML methods in collision risk estimation (2023)\nmashiku2025 \u2014 AI/ML approaches for collision avoidance (2025)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p3", "section_title": "Survey", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.2627551555633545, "rerank_score": -1.3779289722442627}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Post Competition ML", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.2993949055671692, "rerank_score": -2.849654197692871}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p3", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.32164716720581055, "rerank_score": -3.352694511413574}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.36659854650497437, "rerank_score": -2.556392192840576}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3901126980781555, "rerank_score": -2.316218852996826}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p1", "section_title": "Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41103100776672363, "rerank_score": 0.6942858695983887}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p1", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4145451784133911, "rerank_score": -6.1832275390625}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4228861331939697, "rerank_score": -2.074483633041382}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42645978927612305, "rerank_score": -3.68734073638916}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.3_p1", "section_title": "Data Preparation and Setup", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4296910762786865, "rerank_score": -3.115757942199707}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p3", "section_title": "Data Analysis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43131816387176514, "rerank_score": -5.760664939880371}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43237990140914917, "rerank_score": -1.2436103820800781}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4340552091598511, "rerank_score": -4.351836204528809}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C -

Which methods show the most promise for operational deployment?", "expected_sources": ["licata2022", "vanslette2024", "acciarini2021", "catulo2023"], "notes": "licata: MC dropout vs direct probability. vanslette: uncertainty-aware DNNs. acciarini: Bayesian LSTM. catulo: HMM-based.", "use_reranker": true, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "answer": "# Comparison of Uncertainty Quantification Approaches\n\n## Approaches Identified\n\nThe corpus discusses uncertainty quantification (UQ) primarily in the context of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) versus Standard Neural Networks (SNNs), though specific technical implementation details vary across studies.\n\n### Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)\n\nBNNs provide uncertainty estimates by treating model parameters as probability distributions rather than fixed values. To make predictions, the BNN samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters, yielding multiple predictions that reflect parameter uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3). A wider posterior distribution indicates higher uncertainty, while a narrower distribution indicates lower uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3).\n\n### Performance Comparison\n\nBNNs demonstrated superior performance compared to SNNs under specific conditions. Better prediction and classification performance was observed when using methods that account for uncertainty quantification, though this is not universally applicable (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6). BNNs are specifically preferable to SNNs when uncertainty is a necessary output, when there are limited available training data, and when the detection of outlier predictions is important to flag for an operator (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6).\n\n### Calibration Metrics\n\nOne study evaluated UQ approaches using calibration error scores, which measure the average absolute difference between expected and observed cumulative probability across all prediction intervals, with prediction intervals ranging from 5% to 95% with 5% increments plus 99% (licata2022, sec5.5_p1). Models were selected based on lowest prediction error and best calibration scores on validation sets (licata2022, sec8_p1).\n\n## Operational Deployment Considerations\n\n### Advantages for Operations\n\nUQ methodologies offer several operational benefits:\n\n1. **Risk-Based Decision Making**: Uncertainty quantification provides operators with the capability to set thresholds based on acceptable risk (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p5). Performance optimization curves can provide operators with insight into model discrimination performance, threshold selection, and trade-offs between operating conditions (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p5).\n\n2. **Improved Performance**: UQ can support improved performance of AI/ML tools focused on prediction and classification (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6). It has the potential to improve decision-making, risk management, model selection and optimization, and robustness (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).\n\n3. **Uncertainty-Aware Predictions**: Higher uncertainties were observed for misclassified events in conjunction assessment, suggesting potential value in building models that take uncertainties into account at inference time, for instance by outputting a risk distribution instead of a point prediction (uriot2022, sec5.4_p2).\n\n### Challenges for Operational Deployment\n\nDespite the promise, significant challenges exist:\n\n1. **Computational Overhead**: Using UQ algorithms may be challenging because of the complexities of these models and their computational overhead requirements (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10). AI/ML practitioners should be knowledgeable of these trade-offs when considering development of AI/ML tools (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).\n\n2. **Explainability Requirements**: The \"explainability\" paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches posed significant concerns for operational implementation, as conjunction assessment decisions require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n3. **Reliability Standards**: The comprehensive investigation revealed fundamental challenges that limited operational applicability for conjunction assessment, primarily due to stochasticity of data, complex orbital mechanics, and difficulty in achieving the high reliability and explainability standards required for high-value, high-risk space operations decision-making (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n4. **Additional Work Required**: While machine learning techniques with UQ showed theoretical promise, significant additional work would be needed to overcome stochastic data limitations, improve model interpretability, and demonstrate reliable performance via validation across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios before operational deployment (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Recommendations for Operational Deployment\n\nThe DoD should continue to consider the value of uncertainty quantification methodologies when developing and deploying operational AI/ML tools (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10). Additionally, SDA operators should be trained to use the uncertainty quantification provided by these methodologies (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p5). AI/ML tool developers should consider SDA processes and limitations that have implications for tool design, including the selection of algorithms, metrics of performance, and benchmark requirements (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p5).\n\n## Information Gaps\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Detailed comparisons of specific UQ techniques beyond BNN vs. SNN\n- Quantitative performance metrics comparing different UQ methods\n- Specific computational cost comparisons between approaches\n- Direct evidence of operational deployments or field testing results\n- Comparisons with other UQ methods such as ensemble approaches, Monte Carlo dropout, or conformal prediction\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nlicata2022 \u2014 Uncertainty Quantification Approaches (2022)\nmashiku2025 \u2014 Findings and Challenges in ML for Conjunction Assessment (2025)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 \u2014 AI/ML for Space Domain Awareness (2024)\nuriot2022 \u2014 Difficulty of samples in Conjunction Assessment (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p10", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.34814131259918213, "rerank_score": 2.3146486282348633}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p5", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39593249559402466, "rerank_score": -0.42050251364707947}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec8_p1", "section_title": "CHAMP Model", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.44781357049942017, "rerank_score": -5.295825481414795}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p3", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47665828466415405, "rerank_score": -2.0831265449523926}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.4_p1", "section_title": "Managing Uncertainty", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.48953330516815186, "rerank_score": -5.913000583648682}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p6", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4932742118835449, "rerank_score": 0.839563250541687}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec4.5.1_p1", "section_title": "Additional BNN Features", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5149248838424683, "rerank_score": -6.768559455871582}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.3.2_p3", "section_title": "Neural Network Architecture", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5240066647529602, "rerank_score": -2.657470703125}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.4_p2", "section_title": "Difficulty of samples", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.529446005821228, "rerank_score": -5.64199161529541}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.3_p6", "section_title": "Competition metric", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5346046090126038, "rerank_score": -10.61263656616211}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec2.2_p1", "section_title": "Bayesian machine learning", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5347983837127686, "rerank_score": -8.293122291564941}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.4_p2", "section_title": "Managing Uncertainty", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5374981164932251, "rerank_score": -8.16934871673584}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.5_p3", "section_title": "Model Evaluation", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5380645990371704, "rerank_score": -10.67597770690918}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p5", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5403598546981812, "rerank_score": -2.8997042179107666}, {"source_id": "vanslette2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5523836016654968, "rerank_score": -6.553170680999756}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec2.2_p3", "section_title": "Hidden Markov Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5575061440467834, "rerank_score": -8.041007995605469}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.5_p2", "section_title": "Comparison of Pc Estimates for Temporally Isolated Conjunctions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5578721165657043, "rerank_score": -8.349124908447266}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.5_p1", "section_title": "Metrics", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5638309717178345, "rerank_score": -5.6480278968811035}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p4", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5650862455368042, "rerank_score": -5.876856803894043}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5_p1", "section_title": "Findings and Challenges", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5676087141036987, "rerank_score": 1.2164729833602905}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p10", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "DoD should continue to consider the value of uncertainty quantification methodologies when developing and deploying operational AI/ML tools.

However, the evidence does reveal important challenges and context:\n\n## Evidence of Generalization Challenges\n\nThe evidence identifies generalization across different spacecraft as a recognized challenge, termed \"Type III generalization\" - described as \"Generalization capability to different but nearby RSOs in future epochs\" (peng2018, sec3_p1). This capability is characterized as \"very important for SSA\" and involves \"learning some patterns from a limited number of RSOs, and then applying the knowledge onto other RSOs\" (peng2018, sec3_p1).\n\nOne study explicitly mentions \"catastrophic forgetting\" as a \"universal challenge\" that blocks the \"generalization performance of machine learning techniques (MLTs)\" and results in \"limited improvement on PODP\" (he2024, sec0_p1). This suggests that ML models struggle to retain knowledge when applied to new scenarios, though the evidence doesn't specify whether this applies specifically to cross-spacecraft generalization.\n\n## Evidence of Claimed Success\n\nConversely, some evidence claims successful generalization. Peng and Bai state that their ANN study \"demonstrates and validates the generalization capabilities to future epochs and to different RSOs, which are two situations important to practical applications\" (peng2018, sec0_p1). They further claim that \"ANN's generalization capabilities to future epochs and different RSOs have been rigorously investigated\" (peng2018, sec1_p7).\n\n## Missing Evidence\n\nThe provided evidence does NOT include:\n- Quantitative failure rates or performance degradation metrics when applying models across different spacecraft\n- Specific examples of models failing on spacecraft with different physical parameters (mass, area, ballistic coefficients)\n- Evidence of failure across different orbital regimes (LEO vs VLEO vs MEO/GEO)\n- Comparative analysis showing reduced accuracy when generalizing versus spacecraft-specific models\n\n## REFERENCES\nhe2024 \u2014 Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator for VLEO Spacecraft PODP (2024)\npeng2018 \u2014 Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Using ANN (2018)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.34510308504104614, "rerank_score": 0.2603631615638733}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3_p1", "section_title": "Generalization Capability at Future Epochs", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3647117018699646, "rerank_score": -0.3525048792362213}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Backgrounds", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3754303455352783, "rerank_score": -2.0072438716888428}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Related Work", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38145017623901367, "rerank_score": 0.4052528738975525}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p5", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3816213011741638, "rerank_score": -7.476369380950928}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38196486234664917, "rerank_score": 0.5530825257301331}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p5", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3983891010284424, "rerank_score": -0.14431807398796082}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec5_p2", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4035893678665161, "rerank_score": -2.0339319705963135}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.2_p2", "section_title": "Contributions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41064780950546265, "rerank_score": -5.68306827545166}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5_p1", "section_title": "Findings and Challenges", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4106639623641968, "rerank_score": -7.035808086395264}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p11", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41594433784484863, "rerank_score": -0.15234625339508057}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42223167419433594, "rerank_score": 1.2421014308929443}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42374831438064575, "rerank_score": 0.4039417505264282}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p8", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43680912256240845, "rerank_score": -1.4720062017440796}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p7", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43713951110839844, "rerank_score": -3.661458969116211}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43851375579833984, "rerank_score": -0.869270384311676}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4401050806045532, "rerank_score": -1.483980655670166}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.44149136543273926, "rerank_score": -2.338977336883545}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec3_p5", "section_title": "Orbit Determination", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4417803883552551, "rerank_score": -6.550715446472168}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.44276225566864014, "rerank_score": 1.5319069623947144}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "PODP faces a series of challenges in practical situations.

Dataset Imbalance and Quality Issues**\n\nThe ESA Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge revealed that \"several challenges, mostly derived from the unavoidable unbalanced nature of the dataset, had to be accounted for\" and \"the use of automated, off-the-shelf ML pipelines were limited\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1). Additionally, not all events in collision avoidance datasets are suitable for ML approaches due to operational constraints - approximately 37.2% of events do not satisfy the CDM (Conjunction Data Message) requirements needed for ML training (catulo2023, sec3.1_p2).\n\n**2. Baseline Performance Competition**\n\nThe ESA competition demonstrated that \"naive forecasting models have surprisingly good performances and thus are established as an unavoidable benchmark for any future work in this subject\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1). This suggests that ML must prove significant advantage over simpler existing methods to justify operational deployment.\n\n**3. Fundamental Tracking Limitations**\n\nNASA notes a more fundamental challenge: approximately \"five-sixths of the objects large enough to leave a satellite in a failed and uncontrolled state if a collision should occur with them will be untracked,\" meaning \"greater than 85% of similarly likely collisions cannot be addressed at all\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec15.1_p3). This indicates that tracking capability itself, regardless of ML application, faces severe limitations.\n\n## Missing Information:\n\nThe evidence does **not** explicitly state why ML has not achieved operational status. The sources indicate ML is viewed as having future potential - with statements that \"ML approaches will be essential in improving collision avoidance analyses and decision making processes in the near future\" (acciarini2021, sec1_p7) - but do not detail specific operational barriers such as:\n- Regulatory or certification requirements\n- Reliability or validation standards\n- Integration challenges with existing systems\n- Risk aversion in operational environments\n\n**RAND sources would be needed** to provide a complete answer to this question.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nuriot2022 \u2014

The ESA Collision Avoidance Challenge dataset demonstrates this starkly: only 365 high-risk events (2.77%) exist compared to 12,789 low-risk events (97.23%) (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This imbalance makes it difficult to train supervised learning models that can accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). The problem is compounded by the fact that 63.5% of all conjunction events have a final risk of \u221230 (the lower truncation bound), representing false alerts (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\n## Training Data Manipulation Required\n\nTo mitigate the class imbalance, researchers must employ special strategies that affect how models are trained. One approach removes events where the naive forecast predicts a final risk of \u221230, since 99.34% of such predictions are correct without misclassifying high-risk events (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). While this reduces the data imbalance and computational requirements, it also means models are trained on a subset that doesn't fully represent operational reality.\n\n## Ground Truth Limitations\n\nThe scarcity of actual collisions creates validation challenges. Training AI/ML systems for Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) operations requires verified ground truth data, but \"comprehensive collision datasets remain limited\" (mashiku2025, sec2_p5). As a result, validation must rely on \"theoretical assessment of close conjunction events characterized by non-zero miss distances\" rather than actual collision outcomes (mashiku2025, sec2_p5).\n\n## Generalization Concerns\n\nThe rarity problem undermines fundamental assumptions about model generalization. The \"temporal analysis revealed that sample cases generated from the same baseline often exhibited completely different behavioral patterns, undermining the assumption that historical patterns could reliably predict future conjunction evolution\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). This suggests that even when models are trained on available rare events, their ability to generalize to future high-risk scenarios remains questionable.\n\n## Information Gaps\n\nThe evidence does not explicitly address several important aspects of how rarity affects validation:\n- How validation set construction deals with the class imbalance\n- Whether cross-validation strategies are modified to account for rare events\n- The specific impact on model evaluation metrics beyond classification accuracy\n- How temporal validation (testing on future data) is affected when high-risk events are so rare\n\nAdditional sources describing validation methodologies, performance metrics used for imbalanced data, and longitudinal validation studies would help address these gaps.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\ncatulo2023 \u2014 Data Analysis and Machine Learning Methods for Collision Risk Estimation (2023)\n\nmashiku2025 \u2014 Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks in ML-Based Conjunction Assessment (2025)\n\nuriot2022 \u2014 Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge: Design and Results (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p3", "section_title": "Survey", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3794419765472412, "rerank_score": -4.594101905822754}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p1", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38029730319976807, "rerank_score": 0.07948685437440872}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C -

The atmosphere drag force, along with solar radiation pressure and RSO shape/attitude motion, is \"difficult to be accurately modeled\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p1). This modeling difficulty creates uncertainty that propagates through prediction systems in several ways.\n\nWhen performing orbit prediction, it is necessary to consider \"the impact of non-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of spacecraft and space debris alike\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec0_p1). Traditional methods like SGP4 \"inadequately account for these forces\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec0_p1), leading to prediction errors.\n\n## How ML Approaches Address Atmospheric Uncertainty\n\nML-based approaches attempt to mitigate atmospheric drag uncertainty through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Error Compensation**: ML models are designed to \"discover the hidden relationship between the available variables and the orbit prediction error from historical data\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p2), with the speculation that \"the effect of these unmodeled factors is hidden in the historical data\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p2).\n\n2. **Parameter Adjustment**: Some methods use ML techniques to \"determine the ballistic coefficients of LEO spacecraft based on orbital data\" to \"minimize prediction errors stemming from uncertainties in drag coefficients and area-to-mass ratios\" (he2024, sec1_p4). Others employ techniques to \"adjust atmosphere model parameters to improve\" traditional orbit prediction methods (he2024, sec1_p4).\n\n3. **Density Modeling**: \"Most machine learning in this area is focused on density estimation\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec6_p2), with models achieving \"errors of approximately 11% on independent test data\" for global density predictions (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n## Uncertainty Propagation Through ML Pipelines\n\nThe evidence describes how atmospheric uncertainty propagates through orbit prediction systems:\n\nCurrent limitations in orbit prediction include \"the simplified modeling of perturbation forces, the unknown information regarding RSO characteristics, and the uncertainty over space weather forecast data\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3). When an estimated state is propagated to a future epoch, it \"will further deviate from the true state because of the error propagation\" (peng2018, sec2.1_p1).\n\nThe problem is particularly acute because \"our inability to forecast it has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations\" (licata2022, sec0_p1). Even with \"perfect forecast of model drivers, our incomplete knowledge of the system results in often inaccurate thermospheric neutral mass density predictions\" (licata2022, sec0_p1).\n\n## Uncertainty Quantification in ML Systems\n\nRecent ML approaches recognize that \"uncertainty in the ML-OP scheme is necessary for industrial use\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec6_p2). Several techniques address this:\n\n- Bayesian approaches that \"predict a distribution\" are being explored, including methods that \"combined Gaussian Processes (GP) uncertainty with EKF-derived uncertainty\" and \"Deep Ensemble to perform variance estimation\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec6_p2).\n\n- Uncertainty-aware AI frameworks that predict covariance alongside state estimates have been developed, where \"the relative size of the predictive covariance is an indicator of how well this 'uncertainty-aware' AI approach understands a given RSO's orbit\" (vanslette2024, sec0_p1). This approach \"overtly predicts large amounts of uncertainty rather than silently producing wrong results\" in outlier situations (vanslette2024, sec0_p1).\n\n- Models using techniques like Monte Carlo dropout and \"direct prediction of the probability distribution\" provide \"well-calibrated uncertainty estimates\" (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\n## Downstream Effects on Collision Probability\n\nRegarding specific downstream effects on collision probability estimates, the evidence is limited:\n\nThe evidence indicates that orbit prediction is \"essential to accurately track and predict debris and satellites' orbits\" to \"avert a chain reaction of collisions, known as Kessler Syndrome\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec0_p1). Current \"approximate physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, which is insufficient when considering space debris, typically with less than one meter\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec0_p1).\n\nWhen used in collision avoidance schemes, orbit prediction \"propagates the state of the RSO until the time of closest approach (TCA) to any actively monitored satellite\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3). One current limitation is \"the Gaussian assumption \u2013 which does not hold against the true distribution\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3), suggesting that probability estimates may be systematically biased.\n\n## Gaps in Evidence\n\n**The provided evidence does NOT contain:**\n- Quantitative analysis of how atmospheric drag uncertainty specifically translates to collision probability uncertainty\n- Comparisons of collision probability accuracy between traditional and ML-based methods\n- Specific failure modes where atmospheric drag uncertainty leads to missed collision warnings or false alarms\n- Studies showing the propagation of density model errors (e.g., the 11% error rate) through to final collision probability estimates\n\nTo answer this question more completely, evidence would be needed from studies specifically examining collision probability calculations, conjunction analysis with ML-based systems, and Monte Carlo simulations showing uncertainty propagation from atmospheric inputs through to probability of collision outputs.\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 \u2014 Introduction (2024)  \nlicata2022 \u2014 Abstract (2022)  \npeng2018 \u2014

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks\nLSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that \"retains memory about an input and utilizes that associated memory value to predict the outcome on a time-dependent series\" and were \"implemented to handle the time-varying nature of CDM data as the conjunction assessments evolves toward TCA\" (mashiku2025, sec3.4_p1).\n\nSpecifically, **Bayesian stacked LSTM architectures** have been implemented that \"return distributions rather than point predictions\" and can predict either the next CDM step-by-step or the entire CDM sequence using the network's predicted CDM at each time step as input for future time steps (acciarini2021, sec4.2_p2).\n\n### 2. Shallow Neural Networks\nShallow binary classification networks were applied to CDM analysis, with different models incorporating varying numbers of information parameters beyond just collision probability (Pc) (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n### 3. Deep Neural Networks\nDeep Neural Networks were applied to static CDM analysis (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n### 4. Gradient Boosting Trees (LightGBM)\nLightGBM was used in conjunction event prediction, with experiments using only numerical features from the last CDM at least two days away from TCA, with \"no other transformations applied to the CDM raw values (such as scaling or embedding)\" and relying on the algorithm's internal mechanisms to handle missing values (uriot2022, sec6.1_p1). This approach \"showed good performance\" during the competition (catulo2023, sec1_p6).\n\n### 5. Hidden Markov Models (HMM)\nHMMs were used with CDMs arranged in descending order regarding time to TCA, considering only the risk parameter, with training data used to infer the HMM parameters (catulo2023, sec3.3_p3).\n\n## Failure Modes Comparison\n\n### LSTM Networks: Insufficient Ground Truth and Poor Generalization\nThe LSTM models \"theoretically offered the most promising approach for handling the evolving nature of conjunction data but suffered from insufficient 'ground truth data' for training and poor generalization to diverse conjunction scenarios\" (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2). \n\nFor long-term predictions, LSTMs face severe degradation: \"both strategies fail in forecasting the full period of data (around 100 years), reaching values of the loss six orders of magnitude larger\" than shorter-term benchmarks, with \"a huge increase of the loss function\" even in just the first year, particularly when using overlapping prediction strategies (mocat_ml2024, sec5.2_p4).\n\n### Shallow Neural Networks: Marginal Improvements\nShallow binary classification networks \"showed marginal improvements in risk classification when incorporating multiple information parameters beyond just Pc,\" with the best-performing model's \"improvement appeared extremely marginal compared to using normal Pc thresholds, raising questions about the practical value of the additional computational complexity\" (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n### Static vs. Temporal Approaches: Limited Use of Time-Series Information\nSurprisingly, \"65% of the teams framed the learning problem as a static one, summarizing the information contained in the time series as an aggregation of attributes (e.g., using summary statistics, or simply the latest available CDM),\" which \"may have been a direct consequence of the great predictive strength of a naive forecast for this dataset\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p4).\n\n### Naive Baseline Dominance\nA critical finding across architectures is that \"the naive/baseline approach (using the risk contained in the last CDM received until the cut-off time as the risk prediction) is a strong predictor for this problem, with only 12 teams out of 97 managing to beat the benchmark solution\" (catulo2023, sec1_p6). This suggests that many sophisticated ML architectures fail to significantly outperform simple baselines.\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Quantitative performance metrics comparing architectures directly\n- Specific failure modes for Deep Neural Networks beyond their application to \"static CDM analysis\"\n- Detailed failure analysis for Hidden Markov Models\n- Computational resource requirements and their relationship to failure modes\n- Specific error patterns or failure conditions for gradient boosting approaches\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nacciarini2021 \u2014

This indicates that as of 2025, ML systems remain in the research and development phase rather than operational deployment.\n\nThe research community has been exploring ML applications in this domain through initiatives like the ESA Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge launched in 2019 (catulo2023, sec1_p5; uriot2022, sec1.1_p1), which aimed to \"study the feasibility of applying machine learning (ML) methods in collision risk estimation\" (catulo2023, sec1_p5). The competition results demonstrated that \"ML models can improve upon [naive forecasting] benchmark, hinting at the possibility of using ML to improve the decision-making process in collision avoidance systems\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1). However, this language clearly indicates potential future application rather than current operational use.\n\nThe evidence further suggests that significant technical challenges remain before operational deployment is feasible. These include the difficulty of modeling \"predictions of future measurement updates\" which \"are nearly impossible to model deterministically since they are not entirely physics-based,\" and the challenge of incorporating \"routine maneuvers as part of normal operations\" which \"are difficult or impossible to model\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1). The source emphasizes that \"these critical limitations must be addressed by any AI/ML approach for it to be operationally viable\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\nThe research community's focus on developing tools like Kessler (acciarini2021, sec1_p7; acciarini2021, sec5_p1) and conducting various studies (catulo2023, sec1_p7) further confirms that the field is still in an experimental phase aimed at enabling future operational systems rather than current deployment.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\nmashiku2025 \u2014 Future Directions and Conclusions (2025)\nuriot2022 \u2014 Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge (2022)\ncatulo2023 \u2014 Introduction (2023)\nacciarini2021 \u2014 Kessler: ML Library for Spacecraft Collision Avoidance (2021)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p3", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.25402504205703735, "rerank_score": 2.357388496398926}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Post Competition ML", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.29872971773147583, "rerank_score": 0.5420531034469604}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3224983215332031, "rerank_score": 2.520998477935791}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3454434871673584, "rerank_score": 1.656337857246399}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.35141563415527344, "rerank_score": 5.494070053100586}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37681806087493896, "rerank_score": 3.5708038806915283}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38229143619537354, "rerank_score": 3.111997604370117}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41687870025634766, "rerank_score": -2.415057897567749}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4171708822250366, "rerank_score": 4.425599098205566}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec4.2.2_p4", "section_title": "Data Analysis and Results", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4279356002807617, "rerank_score": -3.0402350425720215}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C -

In fact, the evidence suggests that ML approaches are still under investigation and have not yet achieved operational reliability.\n\nThe most significant finding across the evidence is that **naive forecasting models perform surprisingly well and serve as benchmarks** (uriot2022, sec7_p1). According to this source, while ML models can improve upon naive benchmarking approaches, the competition results showed that \"naive forecasting models have surprisingly good performances and thus are established as an unavoidable benchmark for any future work in this subject\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1).\n\nSeveral ML approaches have been explored in research:\n\n1. **Generative modeling approaches** have been investigated as an alternative to discriminative binary-classification, with researchers focusing on methods that \"describe the temporal evolution of a sequence of CDMs given all previously observed CDMs\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM models** are mentioned as potentially promising for ingesting time-series information, though this is suggested as a future research direction rather than a proven solution (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\n3. **Bayesian deep learning with recurrent neural network architectures** has been studied for generating CDMs (catulo2023, sec1_p7).\n\nHowever, the evidence is clear that **current ML approaches lack operational reliability**: \"While AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making, several promising directions for future research remain\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\n**What information is missing:** The evidence does not provide comparative performance metrics between different ML approaches, head-to-head evaluations, or operational validation results that would allow determination of which single approach is \"best.\" More recent operational data and systematic comparative studies would be needed to answer this question definitively.\n\nREFERENCES\nacciarini2021 \u2014 Kessler:

This represents an extremely small fraction of high-risk events.\n\n## After Data Cleaning\n\nAfter data cleaning processes, one analysis reported 7,187 (99.3%) low-risk events and only 50 (0.7%) high-risk conjunctions (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2). This represents a ratio of approximately 144:1 (low-risk to high-risk).\n\n## Full Dataset Classification\n\nWhen classifying the full dataset using the risk threshold of -6 (where events with risk lower than -6 are considered low-risk), the dataset contained 12,789 low-risk events (97.23%) and 365 high-risk conjunctions (2.77%) (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This represents a ratio of approximately 35:1 (low-risk to high-risk).\n\nThe evidence indicates that \"dealing with such imbalanced data poses to be the major challenge of this work\" (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2) and that \"the data imbalance problem poses to be the main challenge in collision risk estimation using ML methods\" (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\nIt's important to note that the class imbalance ratio depends heavily on the risk threshold chosen and any data cleaning procedures applied. The evidence also reveals that models were trained without \"any steps to address the existing class imbalance\" (uriot2022, sec6.1_p3).\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nuriot2022 \u2014 Database of Conjunction Events (2022)\ncatulo2023 \u2014 Model Results and Data Analysis (2023)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec3_p4", "section_title": "Database of Conjunction Events", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.34663695096969604, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p10", "section_title": "Model Results", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3909757137298584, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6.1_p3", "section_title": "Training/test set loss correlation", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.396881103515625, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.2_p2", "section_title": "Data Cleaning", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.40709733963012695, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec8_p7", "section_title": "Appendix E: Use of Analytic Theory Orbital Data in Conjunction Assessment", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4173203706741333, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p3", "section_title": "Data Analysis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43206149339675903, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec18.9.2_p1", "section_title": "Evaluation of Propagation from Epoch to TCA", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.44767093658447266, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p2", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47622281312942505, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p5", "section_title": "Model Results", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4783964157104492, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.5_p3", "section_title": "Data split", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.48284590244293213, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec17.1_p1", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.48984014987945557, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p4", "section_title": "Test and training sets", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5054507255554199, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.4_p3", "section_title": "Conjunction Assessment in Cislunar Space", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5103403329849243, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6.2_p11", "section_title": "Simulating 10,000 virtual competitions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5103750228881836, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p5", "section_title": "Survey", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5124430656433105, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec6.3_p5", "section_title": "Conjunction Risk Assessment", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.513267457485199, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.2_p2", "section_title": "Identification of Parameters Associated with High-Risk Events", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5187969207763672, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec8_p5", "section_title": "Appendix E: Use of Analytic Theory Orbital Data in Conjunction Assessment", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5228243470191956, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec6.3_p10", "section_title": "Conjunction Risk Assessment", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5237804055213928, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p7", "section_title": "HASDM Model", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.524283766746521, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec3_p4", "section_title": "Database of Conjunction Events", "text_preview": "[Table 1: Database of conjunction events at a glance.] The database contains 15,321 events, of which 30 are high-risk events (r >= 10^\u00e2\u02c6\u20194), 131 are high-risk events (r >= 10^\u00e2\u02c6\u20195), and 515 are high-r...", "distance": 0.34663695096969604, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p10", "section_title": "Model Results", "text_preview": "As previously mentioned, an entire distribution is obtained for each prediction, so prediction intervals can be provided for each event.

The study applied these two uncertainty methods to create models based on both (1) PCA coefficients of the SET HASDM density database and (2) localized accelerometer-derived density estimates from CHAMP (licata2022, sec10_p1).\n\nThe key findings from the comparison include:\n- For the HASDM database, the MC dropout and direct probability distribution prediction models had similar metrics in terms of error and calibration (licata2022, sec10_p1)\n- The calibration curves for the PCA coefficients were nearly identical between the two methods (licata2022, sec10_p1)\n- The NLPD loss function provides similar results for both techniques, but the direct probability distribution prediction method has a much lower computational cost (licata2022, sec0_p2)\n\nThe authors note that while other methods exist for space weather applications such as Gaussian Process (GP) regression and ensemble modeling, the two examined techniques provide \"a sufficient starting point\" (licata2022, sec10_p6).\n\n**REFERENCES**\nlicata2022 \u2014 [Title not provided in evidence] (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "[Untitled Introduction]", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3213620185852051, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec10_p1", "section_title": "Discussion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3635063171386719, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "[Untitled Introduction]", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37500178813934326, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec6_p4", "section_title": "Toy Problems", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37510019540786743, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p6", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3833851218223572, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "SET HASDM Density Database", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3870531916618347, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec10_p6", "section_title": "Discussion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39059019088745117, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39945125579833984, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41255712509155273, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p8", "section_title": "HASDM Model", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4132235050201416, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec14.1_p4", "section_title": "Use Raw Observation Data Only and Combine with SSN Observations for a Single Solution", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4271143078804016, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec10_p3", "section_title": "Discussion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42948681116104126, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p9", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45273786783218384, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec17.4.1_p5", "section_title": "Estimating the Masses of Unknown Objects", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4558364152908325, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p2", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45842087268829346, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p9", "section_title": "HASDM Model", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45986586809158325, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p3", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4629281163215637, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.7.1_p3", "section_title": "Input Covariance Data Considerations", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4669990539550781, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p8", "section_title": "Generation of Orbital Decay Training Set", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47153449058532715, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1.1_p1", "section_title": "Machine Learning", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47707605361938477, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "[Untitled Introduction]", "text_preview": "Even with these improvements, density models have high errors, and we generally use them without any knowledge of their confidence given the conditions.

This is the common practice in machine learning (peng2018, sec3_p1). This type involves interpolation, accurately determining an object's state for an unknown section based on initial and final states (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1).\n\n**Type II: Generalization capability to future epochs.** The testing data are restricted to be in the future epoch with respect to the training data. This reflects the realistic orbit prediction problem (peng2018, sec3_p1). This type involves forecasting, where an algorithm is trained to predict the future position of a space object beyond the training data timeframe (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1).\n\n**Type III: Generalization capability to different but nearby RSOs in future epochs.** This capability means learning patterns from a limited number of RSOs (Resident Space Objects), and then applying the knowledge onto other RSOs. This is described as a generalization type that can be very important for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) (peng2018, sec3_p1). This type extends ML capabilities to extrapolate information from one object to predict the orbit of a different space object (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1).\n\n## REFERENCES\n\npeng2018 \u2014 Machine Learning for Orbit Prediction (2018)\n\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 \u2014 Precise Orbit Prediction using Machine Learning (2024)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3_p1", "section_title": "Generalization Capability at Future Epochs", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38853025436401367, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Related Work", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.416126012802124, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Backgrounds", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45018213987350464, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3.4_p6", "section_title": "Effect of Network Structure", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4524478316307068, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p15", "section_title": "Generation of Orbital Decay Training Set", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4559504985809326, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec5_p2", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4583284258842468, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p8", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4591156244277954, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3.4_p5", "section_title": "Effect of Network Structure", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4632464647293091, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p11", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.46783798933029175, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47511082887649536, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3.2_p1", "section_title": "Generalization Performance at Future Epochs", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4795980453491211, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p7", "section_title": "Varying Semi-Major Axis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.48479461669921875, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4850834012031555, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p5", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4965939521789551, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p4", "section_title": "Varying Semi-Major Axis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.49710142612457275, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.503032922744751, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.2_p2", "section_title": "Contributions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5035098195075989, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p6", "section_title": "Varying Semi-Major Axis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5036683678627014, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5044911503791809, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p7", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5045204758644104, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3_p1", "section_title": "Generalization Capability at Future Epochs", "text_preview": "As has been proposed and discussed in our previous study, for the orbit prediction problem, there exist three types of generalization capabilities of the ML approach: Type I: Generalization capability...", "distance": 0.38853025436401367, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Related Work", "text_preview": "To bridge the gap between time-consuming numerical methods and inaccurate analytical models, error-correction techniques have been applied in a series of papers, all using a similar approach, that inv...", "distance": 0.416126012802124, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Backgrounds", "text_preview": "In this section, we first briefly review the ML approach to improve orbit prediction accuracy using a simulated space catalog environment.

According to He et al., \"the dynamic factors influencing the decay, such as the space environment and spacecraft physical parameters, pose a challenge of catastrophic forgetting for conventional MLT\" (he2024, sec1_p6). This challenge specifically limits the generalization performance of machine learning techniques in precise orbit decay prediction (PODP), as \"generalization performance of machine learning techniques (MLTs) is blocked by the universal challenge known as catastrophic forgetting, resulting in limited improvement on PODP\" (he2024, sec0_p1).\n\nThe problem is particularly acute because current model-agnostic MLTs \"face limitations in terms of their generalization capabilities\" when dealing with the varying dynamic factors that affect orbit decay (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n## He 2024's Solution: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)\n\nTo address catastrophic forgetting, He et al. employ **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** as part of their Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (EODP) method. The authors note that \"EODP employs a deep NN (DNN) as the fundamental learner to comprehend the decaying rule and incorporates the theory of EWC\" (he2024, sec1_p7).\n\n### Why EWC Was Chosen\n\nThe choice of EWC was deliberate among several possible regularization-based approaches. The evidence indicates that while various strategies exist to enhance generalization performance\u2014including \"optimization-based methods (like meta-learning), replay-based techniques (such as experience replay), and regularization-based approaches (like elastic weight consolidation [EWC])\"\u2014each has specific advantages for different scenarios (he2024, sec1_p6). Specifically, \"EWC is particularly suited for regression problems with abundant training data\" (he2024, sec1_p6), which aligns well with the orbit decay prediction problem.\n\n### How EWC Works\n\nEWC addresses catastrophic forgetting by \"combin[ing] historical and recent training data to update the NN parameters by applying a penalty function\" (he2024, sec1_p6). This approach is \"commonly used to process large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets\" (he2024, sec1_p6).\n\n## Results\n\nThe EODP method incorporating EWC achieved substantial improvements: \"The model achieves at least a 70% improvement in accuracy compared to the high-precision orbital propagator (HPOP) and presents a novel approach for the future implementation of machine learning\u2013based methods in the field of orbit prediction\" (he2024, sec0_p1).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 \u2014 Very Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Orbit Decay Prediction Based on Expandable Orbit Decay Propagator (2024)\n\npeng2018 \u2014 Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem (2018)\n\nsurvey_ml_orbit2024 \u2014 Survey of Machine Learning in Orbit Prediction (2024)\n\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 \u2014 Precise Orbit Prediction using Machine Learning (2024)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.30898362398147583, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37473487854003906, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3748103380203247, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p5", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3851904273033142, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3952840566635132, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p6", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.397912859916687, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Related Work", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4061458706855774, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41107672452926636, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4136850833892822, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec3_p1", "section_title": "Generalization Capability at Future Epochs", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4201139807701111, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Backgrounds", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42599672079086304, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42932993173599243, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p11", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4304888844490051, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.2_p2", "section_title": "Contributions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4310171604156494, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p8", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43301182985305786, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43428951501846313, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "esa_environment2025", "chunk_id": "sec6.1_p6_1", "section_title": "End-Of-Life Operations in Low Earth Orbit", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.44218289852142334, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.3_p3", "section_title": "Description of EODP", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4459379315376282, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4466515779495239, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p1", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45193910598754883, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "Very low earth orbit (VLEO) spacecraft have become an attractive proposition with obvious advantages in various missions, including communication and ground observation.

This allows the network to return **distributions rather than point predictions** (acciarini2021, sec4.2_p2), which is crucial for expressing uncertainty in conjunction event predictions.\n\nThe architecture treats conjunction prediction analogously to statistical language models in machine learning, where the model predicts the probability of the next element in a sequence conditioned on all previously observed elements (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p2).\n\nREFERENCES:\nacciarini2021 \u2014 Kessler: an open-source Python package for machine learning applied to collision avoidance (2021)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec4.3_p1", "section_title": "Probabilistic programming module", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3488743305206299, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec4_p1", "section_title": "Software Architecture", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37315309047698975, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec1_p8", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3746371865272522, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec1_p9", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4224473237991333, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p2", "section_title": "Machine learning module", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4249938726425171, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p2", "section_title": "Test and training sets", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45029228925704956, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45993173122406006, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec0_p4", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47027480602264404, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p2", "section_title": "Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.475011944770813, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p1", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4752260446548462, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p1", "section_title": "Machine learning module", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4862537384033203, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec14.1_p3", "section_title": "Use Raw Observation Data Only and Combine with SSN Observations for a Single Solution", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4937119483947754, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec5_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5030173063278198, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec3.4_p3", "section_title": "Supervised Machine Learning Approaches with Time-Series Capture (Regression Neural Networks)", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5277426242828369, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec3.2_p1", "section_title": "A generative probabilistic model for spacecraft orbits, collisions, and CDM generation", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5327469706535339, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec2.2.2_p2", "section_title": "Hidden Markov Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5340750813484192, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p4", "section_title": "Satellite C - Maneuverable Asset Response", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5349888801574707, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec3.6_p1", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5412907600402832, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec3_p4", "section_title": "Database of Conjunction Events", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5424269437789917, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec0_p3", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.545875072479248, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec4.3_p1", "section_title": "Probabilistic programming module", "text_preview": "A key novelty of the Kessler package is its probabilistic programming module, which uses PyProb [6], a universal probabilistic-programming framework based on PyTorch.

The evidence shows that combining both RGB and depth images was critical for robust classification, with the paper stating that \"both RGB and depth images are important to get more robust classification\" (aldahoul2022, sec4.2_p14).\n\nThe multi-modal approach proved particularly valuable for difficult cases. For example, the Cloudsat spacecraft category showed low F1 scores when using RGB features alone (6% with ResNet50-SVM, 10% with EfficientNetB7-SVM), but the End-to-End CNN using depth images achieved 52% F1 score for this category, and the multi-modal combination increased it to 48% overall (aldahoul2022, sec4.2_p6; aldahoul2022, sec4.2_p8).\n\nThe classification task involved recognizing eleven

Training AI/ML systems for Conjunction Assessment Risk Analysis (CARA) operations requires access to verified ground truth data, but comprehensive collision datasets remain limited (mashiku2025, sec2_p5). This creates a bottleneck for developing reliable ML systems, as the research concluded that **significant advances in data collection** would be required before ML techniques could be considered viable for operational conjunction assessment applications (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3).\n\n## Stochasticity and Reliability Issues\n\nNASA found that ML approaches face **fundamental challenges due to the stochasticity of the data and the complex and stochastic nature of orbital mechanics** (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). This stochastic nature limited the operational applicability of machine learning approaches. The research highlighted that while ML techniques showed theoretical promise, **significant additional work would be needed to overcome stochastic data limitations** and demonstrate reliable performance across the full spectrum of operational conjunction scenarios (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Explainability Requirements\n\nA critical operational challenge is the **\"explainability\" paradox inherent in many machine learning approaches**, which posed significant concerns for operational implementation (mashiku2025, sec5_p1). Conjunction assessment decisions are high-stakes and require clear justification and understanding of the underlying reasons and factors for each outcome. The difficulty in achieving the **high reliability and explainability standards required for a high-value, high-risk space operations decision-making paradigm** was identified as a primary limitation (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Validation and Model Interpretability\n\nNASA identified that **advances in model interpretability and validation methodologies** would be essential prerequisites (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3). ML models must demonstrate reliable performance via validation across diverse operational scenarios before operational deployment can be considered (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Scope of Implementation\n\nThe research suggests that future ML approaches must be **carefully constrained in problem domain with realistic expectations**. While ML may find valuable niches within the broader conjunction assessment workflow, the evidence indicates these tools **cannot yet replace traditional physics-based methods entirely** (mashiku2025, sec6_p4).\n\n---\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\nmashiku2025 \u2014 [Title not provided in evidence] (2025)\n\nrand_ai_ssa2024 \u2014 [Title not provided in evidence] (2024)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p3", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.25881367921829224, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C - Maneuverable Asset Response", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.345020592212677, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec1_p5", "section_title": "Introduction and Problem Statement", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3485722541809082, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5_p1", "section_title": "Findings and Challenges", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3532470464706421, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p3", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3647215962409973, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Space Domain Awareness Mission Overview", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3728839159011841, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3770904541015625, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p8", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38472747802734375, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p9", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39690321683883667, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p4", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.40500766038894653, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec9_p1", "section_title": "Appendix F: Expected Conjunction Event Rates", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4057111144065857, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p3", "section_title": "Current AI/ML Efforts in SDA", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.416830837726593, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p3", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4180566668510437, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4189862012863159, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p4", "section_title": "Current AI/ML Efforts in SDA", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4210789203643799, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.3_p1", "section_title": "NASA Partnership with USSPACECOM", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4226168394088745, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p10", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42462658882141113, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p4", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4304983615875244, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p5", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4317091107368469, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec14.1_p2", "section_title": "Use Raw Observation Data Only and Combine with SSN Observations for a Single Solution", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4336581230163574, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p3", "section_title": "Summary", "text_preview": "The approach outlined in this report focuses on the development of two AI/ML case studies that explore the value of AI/ML for SDA mission processes.

Challenges with generalization and artifact generation.", "use_reranker": false, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "answer": "# MOCAT-ML Approaches and Long-Term Forecasting Challenges\n\n## ML Approaches Used\n\nMOCAT-ML employs several deep learning architectures to predict Anthropogenic Space Object (ASO) density distributions. The framework examined and compared \"various data representations, neural architectures, and training strategies...spanning from autoencoders to recurrent neural networks and transformers\" (mocat_ml2024, sec1_p3).\n\nThe model is specifically designed to forecast ASO density distributions over the phase space of orbital elements and area-to-mass ratio (A/m) (mocat_ml2024, sec1_p3). The predictions focus on density distributions over the area-to-mass ratio and perigee phase space, where A/m is discretized into 99 evenly distributed bins in log-scale and perigee is discretized into 36 bins of 50 km in height (mocat_ml2024, sec3_p3).\n\nThe training data comes from hundreds of simulations generated by MOCAT-MC, the validated Monte Carlo variant of MOCAT (mocat_ml2024, sec1_p3). MOCAT-MC considers various stochastic processes such as probability of collision and physical parameters of newly generated debris objects (mocat_ml2024, sec3_p2).\n\n## Hybrid Approach\n\nNotably, MOCAT-ML is designed to work cooperatively with traditional methods rather than replace them. The framework uses a hybrid strategy where \"the initial epochs of the evolution are provided by a reliable method (e.g. MOCAT-MC), and then the machine learning model completes the rest of the propagation\" (mocat_ml2024, sec1_p3). This approach aims to balance accuracy and computational efficiency (mocat_ml2024, sec7_p4).\n\n## Long-Term Forecasting Challenges\n\nThe study conducted experiments in long-term forecasting scenarios of approximately 100 years (mocat_ml2024, sec0_p1). The researchers explicitly acknowledge performance degradation over time, stating they \"analyze how and why the performance degrades over time, and discuss potential solutions to make this solution better\" (mocat_ml2024, sec0_p1).\n\nA critical challenge identified is **model generalization**. The researchers note that all training and test simulations belong to one single scenario with an initial population and launch rate multiplied by a factor of 15 (mocat_ml2024, sec6_p4). To evaluate true generalization capabilities, they propose testing the model on \"unexplored scenarios distinct from those utilized in the training set\" to ensure the model \"learns the dynamics behind the evolution of the space environment, and not simply 'memorize' an optimal encoding to reproduce Monte Carlo simulations\" (mocat_ml2024, sec6_p4).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide specific quantitative metrics on:\n- The exact magnitude of performance degradation over the 100-year forecasting period\n- Detailed comparisons of which architectures (autoencoders vs. RNNs vs. transformers) performed best\n- Specific solutions implemented to address the degradation problem\n- Actual test results on scenarios outside the training distribution\n\nAdditional technical papers or validation studies would be needed to understand these specific performance characteristics and solution effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nmocat_ml2024 \u2014 MOCAT-ML: Machine Learning-based Framework for the MIT Orbital Capacity Assessment Tool (2024)\n\nlicata2022 \u2014 Thermospheric Density Prediction with Machine Learning and Uncertainty Quantification (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p3", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.30605340003967285, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p4", "section_title": "Perspectives", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3085048198699951, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3123990297317505, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3155667781829834, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p4", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3303542137145996, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec3_p2", "section_title": "Dataset", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.34914255142211914, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3787400722503662, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38170087337493896, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec3_p3", "section_title": "Dataset", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38698452711105347, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39199310541152954, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39475083351135254, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p12", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4060509204864502, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p5", "section_title": "Future Challenges and Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.40964794158935547, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41352248191833496, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec3_p1", "section_title": "Dataset", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42418599128723145, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p7", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42512238025665283, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.4_p1", "section_title": "Uncertainty Quantification", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4304581880569458, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4312617778778076, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p13", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4318774342536926, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p2", "section_title": "Future Challenges and Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4333183765411377, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "mocat_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec7_p3", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "The implications of this study are far-reaching.

This was recognized as sufficiently problematic that 65% of competition participants explicitly attempted to address class imbalance (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3).\n\n**Rarity of High-Risk Events**: The dataset exhibits \"extreme\" imbalance, with \"only a very small percentage of the events having a final risk higher than \u22126\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). More fundamentally, \"the rarity of actual collision events in the historical dataset created a severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to train supervised learning models that could accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n**Documented Impact on Model Training**: The class imbalance problem is explicitly identified as one of the \"shortcomings\" of approaching collision avoidance as a \"discriminative binary-classification formulation in ML (i.e., high- vs low-risk events)\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nThe evidence documents several approaches to address class imbalance:\n\n**1. Direct Balancing Techniques**: Survey results show that 65% of participants \"attempted to address class imbalance (e.g., by artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples)\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). However, specific details about which techniques were most effective are not provided in the evidence.\n\n**2. Strategic Data Filtering**: One approach involved removing extremely low-risk events from training. Specifically, events where the naive forecast predicted a final risk of \u221230 were excluded from training data, since \"99.34% of the predictions are correct without any misclassification of high-risk events\" for such cases (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1). This approach \"can help deal with the data imbalance problem, and the volume of training data is reduced, resulting in lower memory requirements and a lower computational time\" (catulo2023, sec3.3_p1).\n\n**3. Shift from Discriminative to Generative Modeling**: Rather than treating the problem as binary classification (high-risk vs. low-risk), researchers proposed \"focus[ing] our attention on the generative modeling of the problem, in other words we would like to deliver ML methods that describe the temporal evolution of a sequence of CDMs given all previously observed CDMs\" (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1). This represents a fundamental reframing of the problem to avoid class imbalance issues inherent in classification approaches.\n\n**4. Alternative Risk Prediction Approaches**: Post-competition work included models that \"predict the final chaser position uncertainties for each event and used those predictions to compute the risk\" rather than directly classifying risk levels (catulo2023, sec1_p7).\n\n## Limitations in the Evidence\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Quantitative comparisons of different class imbalance mitigation strategies\n- Detailed implementation specifics for the balancing techniques used by competition participants\n- Success rates or performance metrics for the proposed solutions\n- Information about whether any solution fully resolved the class imbalance barrier\n\nThe evidence suggests that while class imbalance is widely recognized and various solutions have been attempted, the problem remains a fundamental challenge requiring continued research, as indicated by the post-competition investigations (uriot2022, sec6_p1) and ongoing work to develop alternative modeling approaches (acciarini2021, sec3.1_p1).\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nacciarini2021 \u2014 Kessler: an open-source Python package for machine learning applied to collision avoidance (2021)\n\ncatulo2023 \u2014 Bayesian HMMs for collision avoidance (2023)\n\nmashiku2025 \u2014 Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks in ML for Collision Avoidance (2025)\n\nuriot2022 \u2014 Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge Analysis (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p3", "section_title": "Survey", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.2627551555633545, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Post Competition ML", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.2993949055671692, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p3", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.32164716720581055, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.36659854650497437, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3901126980781555, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p1", "section_title": "Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41103100776672363, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p1", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4145451784133911, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4228861331939697, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.42645978927612305, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.3_p1", "section_title": "Data Preparation and Setup", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4296910762786865, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p3", "section_title": "Data Analysis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43131816387176514, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43237990140914917, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p1", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4340552091598511, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C -

BNNs provide uncertainty estimates by performing predictions through sampling from the posterior distribution of model parameters, yielding multiple predictions that reflect parameter uncertainty (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.3.2_p3). This approach can quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty sources (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec2.4_p1).\n\n**Standard Neural Networks (SNNs)** are compared as the baseline approach without inherent uncertainty quantification capabilities.\n\n## Comparative Performance\n\nThe evidence indicates that **BNNs show superior performance** when uncertainty quantification is required.

However, the authors note this is not a universal finding, as \"there may be instances where the reverse is possible\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6).\n\n## Operational Advantages of BNNs\n\nBNNs are identified as preferable to SNNs under specific operational conditions:\n- When uncertainty is a necessary output\n- When there are limited available training data\n- When detection of outlier predictions is important to flag for an operator (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p6)\n\nA particularly valuable operational feature is that BNNs can identify out-of-distribution data by producing high-uncertainty estimates, which could serve as an alert flag for operators (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec4.5.1_p1).\n\n## Operational Deployment Challenges\n\nDespite their advantages, uncertainty quantification methods face implementation challenges. The evidence notes that using these algorithms \"may be challenging because of the complexities of these models and their computational overhead requirements\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10). AI/ML practitioners within DoD are advised to be knowledgeable of these trade-offs when considering development (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10).\n\n## Supporting Evidence from Practice\n\nThe practical value of uncertainty quantification is supported by observational evidence: higher uncertainties were generally associated with misclassified events in conjunction assessment, suggesting that models incorporating uncertainty at inference time (such as outputting risk distributions instead of point predictions) may provide value (uriot2022, sec5.4_p2).\n\n## Model Selection and Evaluation\n\nThe evidence indicates that models incorporating uncertainty techniques were selected based on \"lowest prediction error and best calibration scores\" (licata2022, sec8_p1), though specific comparative results between different uncertainty quantification methods are not provided in the evidence.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThe DoD is advised to \"continue to consider the value of uncertainty quantification methodologies when developing and deploying operational AI/ML tools\" (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec5_p10), with operators requiring training to use the uncertainty quantification provided by these methodologies (rand_ai_ssa2024, sec0_p5).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Quantitative comparisons of specific uncertainty quantification methods beyond BNN vs. SNN\n- Details on other uncertainty quantification techniques (e.g., ensemble methods, Monte Carlo dropout)\n- Specific computational overhead measurements\n- Real-world operational deployment results\n- Comparative analysis of different BNN implementation approaches\n\nREFERENCES\n\nlicata2022 \u2014 CHAMP Model (2022)\nrand_ai_ssa2024 \u2014 AI/ML for Space Domain Awareness

However, the corpus does reveal important insights about generalization challenges:\n\n## Generalization Types Identified\n\nThe evidence identifies three types of generalization capabilities for ML approaches in orbit prediction, with Type III specifically addressing cross-spacecraft generalization: \"Type III: Generalization capability to different but nearby RSOs in future epochs. This is a generalization type that can be very important for SSA. Basically, this capability means learning some patterns from a limited number of RSOs, and then applying the knowledge onto other RSOs\" (peng2018, sec3_p1). This same taxonomy is confirmed in later work, where \"Type-III extends ML capabilities to extrapolate information from one object to predict the orbit of a different space object\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1).\n\n## Evidence of Limitations\n\nThe corpus notes that ML approaches are typically trained on \"historical data specific to a given satellite\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.1_p1), suggesting that models may be satellite-specific rather than generalizable. Furthermore, recent work has revealed \"several fundamental challenges that limited their operational applicability for conjunction assessment primarily due to stochasticity of the data, the complex and stochastic nature of orbital mechanics\" (mashiku2025, sec5_p1).\n\n## Insufficient Evidence\n\n**Critical gap**: The provided evidence does NOT contain specific experimental results or quantitative data demonstrating that ML models **fail** to generalize across different spacecraft or orbital regimes. While Type III generalization is identified as an important capability (peng2018, sec3_p1), the corpus does not include:\n- Performance metrics comparing Type III vs. Type I/II generalization\n- Failure cases when applying models trained on one spacecraft to another\n- Analysis of performance degradation across different orbital regimes (LEO, MEO, GEO)\n- Comparative studies of generalization across spacecraft with different characteristics\n\nThe evidence suggests this is a recognized research area but does not provide concrete failure mode data.\n\n## REFERENCES\npeng2018 \u2014 Machine

This suggests that the inherent characteristics of collision avoidance data present obstacles to straightforward ML implementation.\n\n### Benchmark Performance\nInterestingly, \"naive forecasting models have surprisingly good performances and thus are established as an unavoidable benchmark for any future work in this subject,\" though ML models can improve upon such benchmarks (uriot2022, sec7_p1). This indicates that while ML shows promise, the margin of improvement over simpler methods may be a factor in operational adoption decisions.\n\n### Fundamental Tracking Limitations\nA NASA handbook notes that \"roughly speaking, about five-sixths of the objects large enough to leave a satellite in a failed and uncontrolled state if a collision should occur with them will be untracked\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec15.1_p3). This fundamental limitation in catalog completeness affects any collision avoidance system, regardless of whether ML is used.\n\n## What Information Is Missing\n\nThe evidence does not explicitly state organizational or technical barriers to **operational deployment** of ML systems. To fully answer your question, sources would need to discuss:\n- Certification and validation requirements for operational systems\n- Integration challenges with existing operational workflows\n- Computational or latency constraints in operational environments\n- Liability or decision-making authority concerns\n- Specific RAND analyses on this topic\n\nThe available evidence focuses primarily on research potential and feasibility studies rather than operational deployment barriers.\n\n## REFERENCES\nuriot2022 \u2014 Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Challenge (2022)\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 \u2014 NASA Conjunction Assessment Handbook (2023)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "survey_ml_rso2024", "chunk_id": "sec3.2.1_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Based Methods", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.49910104274749756, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec2.2_p1", "section_title": "Deep learning for SSA", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4991273880004883, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "newman2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.4_p1", "section_title": "Cis-lunar CA", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.510619580745697, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.516718864440918, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5312311053276062, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p9", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5377978682518005, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5413192510604858, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "massimi2024", "chunk_id": "sec2_p1", "section_title": "Related Works", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5422582626342773, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec15.1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.546904444694519, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "newman2022", "chunk_id": "sec3.3_p1", "section_title": "Trackability", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5511301755905151, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "esa_environment2025", "chunk_id": "sec1.4.1_p2", "section_title": "Notable changes", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5516229867935181, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p1", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5547599792480469, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec17.2_p2", "section_title": "Debris Production Determination Methodology", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5578347444534302, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec2_p4", "section_title": "Collision Avoidance at ESA", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5588966608047485, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "iadc_status2025", "chunk_id": "sec0_p9", "section_title": "Executive Summary", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.565228283405304, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_rso2024", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p3", "section_title": "Non-Machine Learning Processing Methods", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5675637722015381, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.571221113204956, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_rso2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5727219581604004, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec19.5_p1", "section_title": "Collision Probability Evolution", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5729609727859497, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p2", "section_title": "Data Analysis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5740343332290649, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "survey_ml_rso2024", "chunk_id": "sec3.2.1_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Based Methods", "text_preview": "The first paper that uses an ML method in our list was proposed in 2014 by Huang, T et al.

{"timestamp": "2026-02-17T06:51:40.999201+00:00", "query_id": "S05", "category": "synthesis", "sub_question": 6, "query": "How does the extreme rarity of actual collision events affect both ML model training and validation across the studies in this corpus?", "expected_sources": ["mashiku2025", "uriot2022", "catulo2023", "liou2008"], "notes": "Connects class imbalance (training) with validation impossibility (no ground truth collisions). liou2008 provides physical context.", "use_reranker": false, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "prompt_version": "v1.0", "answer": "# Impact of Extreme Rarity of Collision Events on ML Training and Validation\n\nThe extreme rarity of actual collision events creates severe challenges for both ML model training and validation across multiple dimensions, as documented in the corpus.\n\n## Class Imbalance Problem\n\nThe dataset exhibits severe class imbalance, with high-risk events representing only 2.77% of the total dataset (365 high-risk conjunctions out of 13,154 total events), while low-risk events comprise 97.23% (12,789 events) (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). This fundamental imbalance was explicitly recognized as \"the main challenge in collision risk estimation using ML methods\" (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3). Furthermore, 63.5% of all conjunction events had a final risk value of -30 (the truncation threshold), representing false alerts (catulo2023, sec3.1_p3).\n\nThe rarity of actual collision events creates \"a severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to train supervised learning models that could accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe encounters\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). This challenge is compounded by the limited availability of verified ground truth data, as \"comprehensive collision datasets remain limited\" (mashiku2025, sec2_p5).\n\n## Training Set Size and Generalization\n\nThe scarcity of high-risk events becomes critical when datasets are split for training and testing. In simulated competitions with a 95% test set split, training sets contained merely 523.0 events, of which only 10.8 were high-risk events (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9). With such \"insufficient data to learn from, the models quickly overfit and failed to learn generalizable rules,\" resulting in a 12.61% mean gain on training sets but a 7.73% mean loss on test sets relative to baseline performance (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\n## Validation Challenges\n\nThe rarity of collision events severely impacts validation set construction. Half of the competition participants reported attempting to build validation sets with similar properties and risk distribution to the test set, \"albeit failing since most surveyed teams lamented a poor correlation between training and test set performances\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). This suggests that the small number of high-risk events makes it extremely difficult to create representative validation splits.\n\nWhen test sets were small (5% of data), they contained only 523.0 events with 10.8 high-risk cases, making them \"no longer representative\" (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9). This resulted in highly variable performance depending on which specific events ended up in the test set, with a mean gain of only 0.04% but a standard deviation of 9.83% (uriot2022, sec6.2_p9).\n\n## Compensatory Approaches\n\nRecognizing these challenges, 65% of competition participants explicitly attempted to address class imbalance through various approaches such as \"artificially balancing the classes, assigning importance weighing to samples\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p3). However, the evidence does not indicate whether these compensatory approaches were successful.\n\n## Underlying Complexity\n\nBeyond simple numerical scarcity, the rarity problem is compounded by \"the stochastic and non-linear nature of the conjunction evolution\" which creates \"inconsistent parameter behavior patterns that were difficult for machine learning models to capture reliably\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1). The temporal analysis revealed that \"sample cases generated from the same baseline often exhibited completely different behavioral patterns, undermining the assumption that historical patterns could reliably predict future conjunction evolution\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p1).\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide specific quantitative metrics on:\n- How many actual collisions (as opposed to high-risk conjunctions) occurred in the dataset\n- Detailed performance comparisons between different class imbalance mitigation techniques\n- Long-term validation results from operational deployment of these models\n\n## REFERENCES\n\ncatulo2023 \u2014 Data Analysis (2023)\nmashiku2025 \u2014 Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks; Satellite C - Maneuverable Asset Response; Identification of Parameters Associated with High-Risk Events (2025)\nuriot2022 \u2014 Survey; Test and training sets; Simulating 10,000 virtual competitions; Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge (2022)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p3", "section_title": "Survey", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3794419765472412, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p1", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38029730319976807, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C - Maneuverable Asset Response", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.419643759727478, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6_p1", "section_title": "Post Competition ML", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43162572383880615, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p3", "section_title": "Data Analysis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4345139265060425, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p2", "section_title": "Test and training sets", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.43853360414505005, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6.2_p9", "section_title": "Simulating 10,000 virtual competitions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.46542900800704956, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec1.1_p3", "section_title": "Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.471843957901001, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.2_p2", "section_title": "Identification of Parameters Associated with High-Risk Events", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4746887683868408, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1_1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47846680879592896, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p5", "section_title": "Test and training sets", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4822302460670471, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.8.1_p4", "section_title": "Monte Carlo Pc Calculation Techniques", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.49152618646621704, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec1_p5", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.49223482608795166, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec6.2_p2", "section_title": "Simulating 10,000 virtual competitions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.49560385942459106, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.3_p1", "section_title": "Data Preparation and Setup", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.49674761295318604, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.2_p2", "section_title": "Data Cleaning", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4969888925552368, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.499728798866272, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.3_p4", "section_title": "Data Preparation and Setup", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4999575614929199, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.2_p1", "section_title": "Identification of Parameters Associated with High-Risk Events", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5035701990127563, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p2", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5036479234695435, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.1_p3", "section_title": "Survey", "text_preview": "As mentioned in Section 4.2 and reported in Table 1, the dataset for the collision avoidance challenge is highly unbalanced, with the training and test sets not randomly sampled from the dataset.

Current approximate physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, with failures usually due to \"uncertainty around the state of the space object at the beginning of the trajectory, forecasting errors in environmental conditions such as atmospheric drag, and unknown characteristics such as the mass or geometry of the space object\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec0_p1).\n\nThe uncertainty in atmospheric density modeling itself is substantial. Empirical density models have \"a one-sigma accuracy of 10%\u201315%, depending on the model, solar activity, and location\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec5_p7). More critically, \"a 10% error in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light prediction can result in more than 200 km uncertainty for a given satellite after 7 days\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec5_p7), demonstrating how forecast errors in driving features can significantly amplify position uncertainties.\n\n## Propagation Through ML Pipelines\n\nThe evidence describes how ML-based approaches attempt to address atmospheric drag uncertainty, though specific propagation mechanisms are not fully detailed. Traditional orbital prediction methods \"are inaccurate with divergent errors in PODP due to the challenges of modeling the atmosphere and acquiring the physical information of specific spacecraft\" (he2024, sec1_p4). ML techniques have been applied to improve density predictions\u2014for example, models trained on the HASDM density database \"achieve errors of approximately 11% on independent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates\" (licata2022, sec0_p2).\n\nRecent ML approaches integrate \"exogenous variables to capture the effects of non-conservative forces\" (precise_orbit_ml2024, sec1.2_p2) and have shown that \"past information can be leveraged to improve Orbit Prediction,\" with one method reducing \"OP error from 1.5 km/day to 0.1 km/day\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec4_p5).\n\n## Downstream Effects on Collision Probability\n\nThe evidence establishes a direct connection between orbit prediction uncertainty and collision avoidance but lacks specific quantification of how atmospheric drag uncertainty affects collision probability estimates. The orbit prediction process \"propagates the state of the RSO until the time of closest approach (TCA) to any actively monitored satellite\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3), and \"current limitations in Orbit Prediction are the Gaussian assumption \u2013 which does not hold against the true distribution \u2013 the simplified modeling of perturbation forces, the unknown information regarding RSO characteristics, and the uncertainty over space weather forecast data\" (survey_ml_orbit2024, sec1_p3).\n\nOne relevant finding indicates that atmospheric density forecast error can be incorporated into collision risk assessment: \"These fits produce a variance term that can be added to the ballistic coefficient variance in the covariance\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec16.7.1_p3), suggesting that density uncertainties are formally propagated through covariance matrices used in collision probability calculations.\n\nThe broader context emphasizes the stakes: \"Our inability to forecast it has severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and computation of probability of collision between two space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) for decision making in space operations\" (licata2022, sec0_p1).\n\n## Knowledge Gaps\n\n**The evidence is insufficient to fully answer how atmospheric drag uncertainty specifically propagates through ML-based orbit prediction pipelines and quantitatively affects collision probability estimates.** \n\nMissing information includes:\n1. Specific mathematical formulations of how ML models propagate density uncertainty through their predictions\n2. Quantitative relationships between atmospheric density errors and final collision probability estimates\n3. Comparative analysis of uncertainty propagation between traditional physics-based and ML-based approaches\n4. Case studies showing actual collision probability calculation variations due to atmospheric drag uncertainty in ML systems\n\nSources that might help would include: technical papers on ML-based covariance estimation, studies on uncertainty quantification in neural network orbit propagators, and operational analyses from conjunction assessment systems using ML components.\n\n---\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nhe2024 \u2014 Challenges and Methods in PODP (2024)\n\nlicata2022 \u2014 ML Techniques for Thermospheric Density Prediction with Uncertainty (2022)\n\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 \u2014 NASA Collision Avoidance Handbook (2023)\n\nprecise_orbit_ml2024 \u2014 Machine Learning for Precise Orbit Prediction (2024)\n\nsurvey_ml_orbit2024 \u2014 Survey of Machine Learning for Orbit Determination and Prediction (2024)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3584674000740051, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37006014585494995, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p2", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3702263832092285, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "he2024", "chunk_id": "sec1_p4", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3749772906303406, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.7.1_p3", "section_title": "Input Covariance Data Considerations", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.37668734788894653, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3774118423461914, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p5", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3802874684333801, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec5_p7", "section_title": "Thermospheric Density Mass Models", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3868781328201294, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "precise_orbit_ml2024", "chunk_id": "sec1.2_p2", "section_title": "Contributions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38704991340637207, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "licata2022", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3872610926628113, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec4_p11", "section_title": "Orbit Prediction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38804686069488525, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.38880711793899536, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec1_p3", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3894129991531372, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec6_p2", "section_title": "Future Challenges and Conclusion", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.39101868867874146, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec2.1_p1", "section_title": "Machine Learning Approach for Orbit Prediction Problem", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.3970022201538086, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "peng2018", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p6", "section_title": "Varying Semi-Major Axis", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.40147513151168823, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4_p1", "section_title": "Competition Design", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4047771096229553, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "vanslette2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41411876678466797, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec7_p1", "section_title": "Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.41500985622406006, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec5.4_p2", "section_title": "Difficulty of samples", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4150816798210144, "rerank_score": null}], "reranked_chunks": [{"source_id": "survey_ml_orbit2024", "chunk_id": "sec0_p1", "section_title": "Abstract", "text_preview": "Since the late 1950s, when the first artificial satellite was launched, the number of Resident Space Objects has steadily increased.

Specifically, Bayesian recurrent neural networks have been deployed to predict the contents of future CDMs in conjunction events, conditioned on all CDMs received up to that point, with associated uncertainty estimates (acciarini2021, sec0_p3).\n\n**LSTM Networks:** Manhattan LSTMs showed good performance during the Collision Avoidance Challenge (CAC) (catulo2023, sec1_p6). LSTM models designed for time-series prediction using multiple CDM time-series datasets have been theoretically identified as offering \"the most promising approach for handling the evolving nature of conjunction data\" (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n**Gradient Boosting Trees:** These models also demonstrated good performance during the CAC (catulo2023, sec1_p6). LightGBM was specifically used in at least one approach (uriot2022, sec6.1_p1).\n\n**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):** ANNs have been trained to approximate prediction errors based on learning variables, though the specific context appears to be orbit prediction rather than direct CDM forecasting (peng2018, sec2.3_p4).\n\n**Shallow Binary Classification Networks:** These networks showed marginal improvements in risk classification when incorporating multiple information parameters beyond just probability of collision (Pc) (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n**Deep Neural Networks:** These were applied to static CDM analysis (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n## Comparative Failure Modes\n\n### Generalization Failures\n\nLSTM models, despite their theoretical promise for handling temporal evolution, \"suffered from insufficient 'ground truth data' for training and poor generalization to diverse conjunction scenarios\" (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2). This represents a critical failure mode where the architecture cannot adequately learn patterns that transfer across different types of conjunction events.\n\n### Limited Performance Gains Over Baselines\n\nThe naive/baseline approach (using the risk contained in the last CDM received until the cut-off time) proved to be \"a strong predictor for this problem, with only 12 teams out of 97 managing to beat the benchmark solution\" (catulo2023, sec1_p6). For shallow neural networks, the improvement over using normal Pc thresholds \"appeared extremely marginal compared to using normal Pc thresholds, raising questions about the practical value of the additional computational complexity\" (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2).\n\n### Underutilization of Temporal Information\n\nSurprisingly, 65% of teams \"framed the learning problem as a static one, summarizing the information contained in the time series as an aggregation of attributes (e.g., using summary statistics, or simply the latest available CDM)\" rather than utilizing temporal dynamics (uriot2022, sec5.1_p4). This suggests that many ML approaches failed to effectively leverage the sequential nature of CDM data, possibly \"a direct consequence of the great predictive strength of a naive forecast for this dataset\" (uriot2022, sec5.1_p4).\n\n### Architecture-Specific Performance Gaps\n\nThere was \"a stark difference between shallow and deep neural network architectures\" (mashiku2025, sec5.1_p2), with shallow networks showing only marginal improvements over baseline approaches.\n\n## Missing Information\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Detailed quantitative comparisons of failure rates across architectures\n- Specific error distributions or failure scenarios for each architecture type\n- Direct head-to-head performance metrics between different ML approaches\n- Analysis of how different architectures handle specific edge cases or rare conjunction scenarios\n- Information about computational efficiency trade-offs between architectures\n\nAdditional sources providing controlled experimental comparisons, failure case studies, and detailed performance benchmarks across architectures would be needed to fully characterize the comparative failure modes.\n\n##

Specifically, mashiku2025 states that \"AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1). This directly indicates that ML systems remain in the research and development phase rather than operational deployment.\n\nThe research community has been actively exploring ML applications in this domain. The ESA's Collision Avoidance Challenge released a dataset and attracted significant participation with \"96 teams participating, resulting in 862 submissions\" (uriot2022, sec1.1_p1). Multiple post-competition studies have continued to investigate ML approaches (catulo2023, sec1_p7; uriot2022, sec6_p1). Additionally, tools like Kessler have been developed as \"an open-source Python package for machine learning (ML) applied to collision avoidance\" (acciarini2021, sec0_p2), though this appears to be a research tool rather than an operational system.\n\nThe research has shown some promising results, with uriot2022 noting that \"ML models can improve upon such a benchmark, hinting at the possibility of using ML to improve the decision-making process in collision avoidance systems\" (uriot2022, sec7_p1). However, significant challenges remain.

Specifically, when comparing different Probability of Collision (Pc) calculation approaches, the NASA Conjunction Assessment Handbook notes that \"The two-dimensional Nc method produces very nearly the same results as the three-dimensional Nc method but requires much less computation time\" (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec16.5_p2). The handbook also indicates that numerical techniques like Monte Carlo Pc estimation \"are much more computationally demanding\" compared to analytical techniques (nasa_ca_handbook2023, sec16.1_p1).\n\nRegarding ML approaches, the evidence mentions that \"adding more parameters did incrementally improve performance metrics, the marginal benefits were minimal beyond the core parameters of miss distance, Pc, and approach geometry. This finding suggests that the complexity added by incorporating numerous additional parameters might not justify the increased computational requirements and reduced model interpretability from an operational perspective\" (mashiku2025, sec5.2_p4). However, this statement refers to the computational requirements of incorporating additional parameters in ML models, not a direct comparison of ML inference costs versus traditional methods.\n\n**What information is missing:**\n- Direct measurements or estimates of computational time/resources for ML inference in conjunction assessment\n- Comparative benchmarks between ML and physics-based methods in terms of CPU time, memory usage, or other computational metrics\n- Analysis of whether ML approaches offer computational advantages or disadvantages relative to analytical Pc calculations\n\n**Sources that might help:** Detailed performance benchmarking studies or operational implementation reports that include computational profiling data.\n\n---\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\nmashiku2025 \u2014 (Title not provided) (2025)\n\nnasa_ca_handbook2023 \u2014 NASA Conjunction Assessment Handbook (2023)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p4", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.45566338300704956, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p3", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5155314803123474, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.5_p2", "section_title": "Comparison of Pc Estimates for Temporally Isolated Conjunctions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5267134308815002, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C -

explainable outcome that would be needed by decision-makers\" (mashiku2025, sec4.2.2_p4).\n\n**Operational Readiness Concerns:**\nCritically, \"AI/ML approaches investigated to date have not yet demonstrated sufficient reliability for operational collision avoidance decision making\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p1).\n\n## Missing Information:\n\nThe evidence does not provide:\n- Comprehensive comparative studies across all ML approaches\n- Definitive performance metrics comparing different ML methods head-to-head\n- Operational validation results from real-world deployment\n- Clear superiority of any single technique over others in all scenarios\n\nThe research suggests this remains an open area requiring \"more investigation\" (mashiku2025, sec4.2.2_p4) and continued community effort (acciarini2021, sec1_p7).\n\n## REFERENCES\nuriot2022 \u2014 Spacecraft collision avoidance challenge (2022)\ncatulo2023 \u2014 [Title not provided in evidence] (2023)\nmashiku2025 \u2014

In fact, the evidence suggests significant limitations and challenges with ML/deep learning approaches.\n\n## Evidence of ML/Deep Learning Limitations:\n\nThe research concluded that \"significant advances in data collection, model interpretability, and validation methodologies would be required before machine learning techniques could be considered viable for operational conjunction assessment applications\" (mashiku2025, sec5.3_p3). This indicates that ML techniques are not yet considered operationally viable.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence suggests that traditional physics-based methods remain superior: \"future AI/ML approaches may yet find valuable niches within the broader conjunction assessment workflow, even if they cannot yet replace traditional physics-based methods entirely\" (mashiku2025, sec6_p4). The use of \"cannot yet replace\" clearly indicates that deep learning has not been shown to outperform traditional methods.\n\n## Limited Benefits of Additional Complexity:\n\nResearch on parameter identification revealed that while Deep Neural Networks can incorporate numerous parameters, \"the marginal benefits were minimal beyond the core parameters of miss distance, Pc, and approach geometry\" and \"the complexity added by incorporating numerous additional parameters might not justify the increased computational requirements and reduced model interpretability from an operational perspective\" (mashiku2025, sec5.2_p4).\n\n## Data Challenges:\n\nThe available datasets present significant challenges for ML approaches, with extreme class imbalance: one dataset contained \"7 187 (99.3%) low-risk events and only 50 (0.7%) high-risk conjunctions. Dealing with such imbalanced data poses to be the major challenge of this work\" (catulo2023, sec3.2_p2).\n\n## Missing Evidence:\n\nThe corpus does not contain any direct performance comparisons showing deep learning methods achieving better accuracy, precision, recall, or other metrics compared to traditional statistical methods. No comparative benchmarks or validation results are provided in the evidence chunks.\n\n**REFERENCES:**\n- mashiku2025 \u2014 (Title not provided) (2025)\n- catulo2023 \u2014 (Title not provided) (2023)", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p4", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.31305253505706787, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec8_p1", "section_title": "Appendix E: Use of Analytic Theory Orbital Data in Conjunction Assessment", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4203285574913025, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.5_p2", "section_title": "Comparison of Pc Estimates for Temporally Isolated Conjunctions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.4563502073287964, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.3_p3", "section_title": "Fundamental Challenges and Bottlenecks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.46454477310180664, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec1_p7", "section_title": "Introduction", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.47320616245269775, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "catulo2023", "chunk_id": "sec3.2_p2", "section_title": "Data Cleaning", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5026374459266663, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec3.3_p1", "section_title": "Deep Neural Networks", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5117390155792236, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec3_p4", "section_title": "Database of Conjunction Events", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5219997763633728, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.2_p2", "section_title": "Test and training sets", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5281940698623657, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5.2_p4", "section_title": "Identification of Parameters Associated with High-Risk Events", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5385482311248779, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "rand_ai_ssa2024", "chunk_id": "sec4.3_p5", "section_title": "Model Architecture", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.549409031867981, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec3_p2", "section_title": "Machine Learning Approaches Investigated", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.55040442943573, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec3.4_p3", "section_title": "Supervised Machine Learning Approaches with Time-Series Capture (Regression Neural Networks)", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5511525869369507, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec5_p1", "section_title": "Findings and Challenges", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5525767207145691, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "acciarini2021", "chunk_id": "sec3.1_p2", "section_title": "Bayesian ML for spacecraft conjunctions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.554679274559021, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "uriot2022", "chunk_id": "sec4.3_p6", "section_title": "Competition metric", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.55675208568573, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "nasa_ca_handbook2023", "chunk_id": "sec16.8.2_p6", "section_title": "Monte Carlo Pc Calculation Techniques", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5668655633926392, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec6_p2", "section_title": "Future Directions and Conclusions", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5675061941146851, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec4.2.3_p8", "section_title": "Data Analysis and Results", "text_preview": "", "distance": 0.5696814656257629, "rerank_score": null}, {"source_id": "mashiku2025", "chunk_id": "sec2_p5", "section_title": "Satellite C -
